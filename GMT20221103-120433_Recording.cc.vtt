WEBVTT

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
I also notice this. is this the echoing now?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Yes, sir, yes, sir, is it any better thank you although i'm Not here?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Any echo. so he's better Now so company's team you Ted we're gonna get started today.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
By giving you a gentle introduction to how to bring into Pita notebook.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Bring in Pandas on your and Then get started so it's not of your environment.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:47.000
My Anakota environment

00:51:47.000 --> 00:52:03.000
I'll be enough for guys and how to do that I hope you know that's what so mine is coming up.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000
I think, we go to get this recording up with it.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Yeah, you then you recording, we usually send you your recordings.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Yeah, Thank you. Yes, yes. I I also want to.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Sorry for the weekly. do these I just want to relax when i'll be getting this record record of what you say.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Okay, So i'm in documents I'm trying to find my world because that's my workspace.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:55.000
And then starting in the group python kind of okay.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
So today's what Thursday you should get these recordings letters by tomorrow.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Please note that you are getting it on the World Academy, Portuguese.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
I hear a lot of you trying to go to Google and you'll be getting it on your world.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:19.000
I can any ports? Okay, Okay, yeah, platform is a bit different from what we used to know.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.000
How are we going to assess it? Okay, I will spend some time shooting out to us as a platform.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:31.000
What we are doing today. but for now let's see focus on the class.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Proceedings. Okay, Thank you very much. Now, the first we want to do is we want to import pandas right like I said, Pundas is editor ranging to.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
We use it for loading data onto Jupiter book.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:55.000
We usage for accessing Time series data matrix shift data Today we're going to work with both the matrix and Time Series data.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:09.000
We're not going to do any series at the beginning today. but I'm going to introduce you sufficiently to know how to use bundles to get started right? so you write your import statements you both find us how's the best thing

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:23.000
you want to write when you run it please raise your help

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Okay, you run the post statement and tell me if you get an error or not.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000
We don't get an arrow after you run that so it means pandas is loaded.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:48.000
So we are not seeing your screen, sir, my screen So you can see your screen

00:54:48.000 --> 00:55:07.000
You've seen excel screen yeah Powerpoint okay, So when I close that problem this is screen, one just being one.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:21.000
How's it, James? Yeah. alright So I launched, and I have written an import statement for Pandas in my first.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:50.000
So I want you to go ahead and write that I was on that.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Okay.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Okay, So if you've done that that means it will for you so now we .

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.000
I wanted to see if I can pick it file.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
I give you guys. But you know how to avoid that we see our time.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000
I'm booting wasn't on our library that allows us to access small data sets.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:42.000
See bonus on our library keyboard, Sms.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000
S. M. for example. Oh, right, Johnny Portsie Bonnet.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:57:00.000
See, you see, Bond gets in contact for you if he does,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Providing bridges in Spanish screen, pro.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:18.000
I'm coming out explaining later, I want to go once there by the time.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Alright, so we'll do it later. but for now I just want to explain something.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Alright, have you guys been able to import cbone?

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:42.000
All went well. Yes, so cbn I just give it an appointment, so that when I want to walk with it, it's easy to reference.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
I don't know if you type you who would see born each time I want to refer to it.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:54.000
So I just Kristen did with a new name, if you like, and I call it Sdn. So any amount of references are just called Sn.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.000
I will do. you guys understand that? Yes, now, cborn is a library for visualization.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
So you're gonna you're gonna walk a lot with seborn and some other libraries like he's in your next account.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
But for today we are interested in it because it also holds or small data sets.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:18.000
We can work with alright, so i'm gonna see sn that gets.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000
I know that S. India refers to Cbn: All right.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Okay, that has set. I think names. If I run that

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
That allows me to walk right now.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:45.000
It has all these data inside this Okay, not using what i'm looking at Sometimes you want to practice you're.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000
You're cool and you don't have any data to work with you can easily just import cbone and take any.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
So that's what we're going to do today now let me add 2.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:05.000
This, because nobody will read this and say what was the pro smoking when it was right in this

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:25.000
That is what you see raji as he's you wanna meet while speaking

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Okay, So what I've done is i've called this function I see Bond to tell me what kind of data does he want up?

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
I assume you all these data alright. these are all data data tables in C more for today.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:48.000
I didn't work with the irish data alright so i'm gonna show you how to get the irish data from sample, and then use that to do your to do the work.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.000
We're trying to do today, so for that we're gonna see S.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:08.000
N dot loot. They just said, Oh, sorry data sets, you know, and this time is Iris.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Alright, something's wrong with my type in today

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Okay, So this is going to help us load our irs data sets.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Once in ludes that then allows us to be able to walk. You know, with that if I run this, thanks to the time it gives me jeez.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
What did you say

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Okay, So it gives us a small detail that 150 records.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Okay, not not very large, but good enough for us to practice whatever I want to practice. right.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So let me see. Launch the Irish data set

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Right. So this loves the Irish data set for Now this type of data, hand Us is referred to as a matrix data.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000
It's matrix because it consists of columns and rules.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I want to get a you are using excel, or maybe sql do.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Colleagues, my quality team in in data science with quality matrix, right, or it data free each of these headers you have here.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And I I hope you guys are being wrapped up until, as I, they try to explain these concepts, each of these headers you have, which represent volumes, will refer to them as any features alright.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So they are left. maybe I need to explain what this details about.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:10.000
So these data is about printing. What type of flower, what is seen just based on the size of the sepals and the best house of the Pla.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:21.000
On the basis of these dimensions of the beta, on the basis of these dimensions of the battal and

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
the cells of the flaw, we can predict what type of flower it is.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So right now, who can tell me which one is a class variable here, which is a class variable?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I want you to see rectangle variable

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:52.000
David's guinea issues especially they'd be good.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Yeah. Why do order 1, 2, 3, 4, add a independent features, exactly, very correct.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So we are very so the species called

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
All these columns put together are the input variables.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Okay, the independent variables, or whatever name you want alright.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:33.000
So that's what we have here. now. now let me do another data, just so that you guys No.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Okay, So to load the demons data, looting

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So that's going to be S. n at a time in bracket.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I put it in of the data I want to lose that one zoom No.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I'm Yes, so if I run this now very new it works I don't really need to work for me, too.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I'm just trying to figure why data.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Oh, sorry! good,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Okay, So he's trying to ,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:46.000
No addit. Okay, So you can see that this data has looted.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Hey, guys, And this is quite This is quite a bit different.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Right. yes, pro alright, yes, this is about 53,000 anytime.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.000
You finally learn how to do serial stuff with from Mono campus in terms of your modeling.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Just you see one to dilute any data and to your work our practice. Are you guys?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Okay, yes, So I don't want to read in your group chat just somebody's saying, How can I get data?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:26.000
How can I get data? Alright, And you have access to more than 10 different.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Oh, baby, Okay. So you have access to more than 20 different data sets here that you can use to do most of your practices.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:47.000
So i'm just didn't think it was an ask some questions before we start using one patch rick please.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I'm gonna have an issue get to my own cpu here.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Please evaluate mention of the Regulators. how to download it.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Is. Is there any work? I can download it because man is telling me when I run the cell important, the C. board at Sn.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
When I run the set. We're telling you that this building the phone patch, it may take some moment something on nature.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So it issue did you? Did you run this impulse statement in both cbone as Sm: Yes.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Did you guys yeah, this is not connected to the Internet.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Yeah, I think connected You need to be connected to this.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
For the first time when you're trying to import this actually you are not supposed, you don't need to be connected to the Internet.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:54.000
If you if you're in anaconda if you already have pre installed with your ancestor right? let's go ahead.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I don't know you're not going to see what happens because you might be walking in the background where you can stop it from New York

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Go ahead Yeah. just stay with me. You will get the solution.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Okay, go ahead and run this next line alright.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Now for those of you who are gonna be working today with which did us actually use Thefm that's used

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Hmm! I think we should walk with which is what we need downloads data sets.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So i'm going to save this demo data sets, to disk and they shared with you guys right here, so that those of you who don't have it can at least load. it, and use no this is an important skill for all

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:59.000
of you how to save a data frame. Zoom Csv.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
On your computer

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
In order to see me, does the data frame on my computer.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I first need to assign the loaded data to available So I'm gonna copy that and then create a new variable.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I'll call that we will dig up from df most times. Then you reach these data science stations.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:32.000
You can see them referring to data sets idea yeah He's just the that's good to you.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Df means data free. So Df is people and you can't give it any name you want in fact, I can call this particular data about to do.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Now, Gabby, I call it gabby, right? It just teamwork, just so that you guys can see if I run it.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Now that data has been assigned to cabin, so I can now use it for my work.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I can say print got me alright if I run that I give my detail.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Are you guys with me so far

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Yes, somebody lost me somehow. Okay. Got me because I use your name.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
No, no, no, no, no, no! because you use my name. I I went.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I love my tennis. so I gave a little I didn't get to see everything. Okay, But when you do when we try to load the data.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:34.000
No, just from the beginning, from where you say i'll give you an apple name.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Sm: Why, we bought a C Bond it's not because we want to walk with Cpu is because we want to access the data in it.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So let me put that annotation here we, important

01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Nice.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Okay, So just be able to have access to sample data sets in its library. Okay, So now that we've imported it.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I've run it pretty here just to show you all the data sets in the library.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:33.000
You can see there are many. There are probably more than right now that we have this data access to these data, because you put that C one.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
With. Okay, let's display one of the data at the end, does this data here, This this link is data.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And I give you code to loot the data Ssn: which is Ibn dot Lou

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:54.000
That will let me give you access to that data that's the detail for Irish .

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Let's do the demo

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
So now that we have it. had some people said they could not run cbo right right.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Some people didn't have access to cbo I can download this data.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I can download this data and share it with you guys, Yeah, immediately, that you all have access to it.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So that's what i'm trying to do next .

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:32.000
To do that. I need to assign the data that i'm getting from initiative and I said it doesn't matter what name you keep the variable.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
It can be governed. It can be stunnedly it can be God's time.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:44.000
It can be, Jude. you can be you might go. What about it is Okay, So what we went ahead with cabin right? because we love that in so much.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
So we use Garbin as the variable named looting data.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So I run this cell Now, Gabby, as a variable, is now holding that data set.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So what I see the fringe company that's that was do that?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Do you get it so far? gathering? Yes, yes, yes.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Okay, now that got me get it, i'm good go back and just change it from alright, ef means the Okay.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
So now we have it's a frame as a variable now to save it.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:31.000
To this.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:41.000
We're gonna use the Panda on desk 2 on that call. Csv function Alright, that's what we're going to use.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Now, this is very good to see us using pandas for the first time.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Alright, we're gonna be using pandas for the first night to see.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:13:05.000
So I'm gonna see yeah that'll be tf dot bandas doug so on that's called Csv in brackets. now in bracket.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I do not put the path to where I want to save the file.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000
He might.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Hello, I think he's over lock space

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Slash. what name they want to call it? Is not that much?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Their months. dot Csv: So you you see as the so you need to put your full path, or where you want to save the file.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:56.000
If you just put quality in name, hey? you want to seem to fire us, these don't need to be saved.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
In. What about food? I would? Are we going to get out so far?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Yes, both. Okay, but I want it to be somewhere that I can go ahead check, for.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:18.000
So I'm gonna put that. so that's a path. it's good to see if you might drive C. Indy for the code workspace in, and then in that 4 days I was gonna call it that month, let me

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:31.000
go. and for that for you guys, just so that you can see

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:38.000
So if I bring this to view here, it might be very Tiny when it comes.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
But hopefully, you'll be able to see abby food that call works.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:50.000
This I might drive C by open that food right now. these are all the files I have yes, V. file.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
So when I run that cell I use that the new file will appear here.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So let me minimize this, and they run this i've run it now.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000
So let me bring back my

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Anything about the

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Okay, Df: dot, 2 run that

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:41.000
No, I can see the demons there. So right now is 2 MB.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I can put on it just so that you can see the contents i'm launching the it's coming.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I hope, yeah, that's it. so I have current costs color clarity depths table price all the way to the only features we had any data.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000
But Panda's mind adding the index column, this 0, 1, 2, 3, us seen here is this.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Let's go back here and look at it if you go back to your table.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You see these 0? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6 that we have on the table.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:42.000
That's what pandas is compassion we call this index calling taking this index call you

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Let's see I say Give me x so this text is a range starting from 0 to 53,940 records in my data.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
So it does work. Fun does is converting to a call in any data here.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
You can see starts from 0, and the last one should be 53,900 and something.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
So that is it? 53,941 he's 40.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:19.000
He just added the headache so i've saved It but I don't want this index calling me the data.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I don't want it i'm going to receive it and see index.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:42.000
It was the false index it was the false will make it not adding, one, that one I have comment here for some of you.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:18:04.000
The index. It was the false

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
So that was tough and that's from steve in the India.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000
So i'm gonna run this now. I think I should have done this any difference.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So for those of you who might want so that's

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:40.000
What i'll do is just grab the cell probably

01:18:40.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And I will remove all of this alright, also sees

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Okay, So this will be the second method. Okay, So this would be to save the file as Csv.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Without index, call him alright. So if I run this now, I can go back to that You can see I have that 1 one now.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I will launch demons once you see the difference

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
So these is the amounts one you can see. The index column is gone.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I only have Kara, as we first call you, Hello, Clarity!

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You know, and all the rest. If I bring up the original one, which is just that once, you will see the difference.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:05.000
For that month we have school logic. Yeah.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
You can see that we had the index calling it was added there's an index calling.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000
We don't want this because conduct automatically the index is the data.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Do. Do you understand what i'm doing? so far Yes, ?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Yes, sir, Now i'm going to share these documents in the chat window, if you have problems trying to download trying to access metal access sea bones.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Data. Then I suggest you use use it So chapel and do.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Here we go, There is No

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Alright.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Alright it's not going I don't know why

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Okay, he says he's currently used sorry my my my fault let me close it.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Information, alright, so hopefully to go Now

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Yes, she does. No. So please check the chat window.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Now you will see the file * megabytes.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Please download it, and that's what do those who are having issues with Cpon about for the rest of each 5.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So in this short spell you guys have learned how to save it.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
You mean there is no part of the lesson for you.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.000
These 2 cells show you how to save You got to see it as excel to.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
You can do that. Just change Csv. to excel.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:15.000
X. Excel: Okay, I need to save it. so make sure to change the extension to the excels. .

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Yes, evening. So Let's come back to upon us now that we have our data, which is the which is the damage data.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Let's now prove Steve hey? guys at this point.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
You might get you to be technical. So please stick with me.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Okay.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So step one is, how do we lose that data that I just created? I'm gonna show you how to do data.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Oh, so loop now, the rest of you who are listening to me.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:07.000
If you are able to load cbone and download the data and get access to damage data. I want you to run this code and save the file to somewhere in your computer. But we're gonna learn to read it back is that important requirement.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:19.000
For this class today to be able to lose data from your computer to So run these sales, 14 or 19, that I have and see if your data.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:33.000
This is that month. Yes, that ones so not good. So

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Which one is initial good So this is S.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
N dot get the Yes, on the sort of name. Okay, Thank you.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Then, after that you have asked them to lose data sets to Bluetooth, that you're interested in.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Okay, so please make sure you run lines this code to save the file to your disc.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I don't care where you see it but remember where you see, because we need it back.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Bunny, face up with you. Do you have a question?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Yes, pro bye bye, I was covenant and error message.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:32.000
When I wanted to remove the index position on the did awesome.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I don't know what's the error you have to

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Do fine. you do type tip as a smaller F has to be capital.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:55.000
F: Okay, Okay, Thank you for Alright: Okay, ,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Please. Hello, Bro: Yeah. James. Yeah. So I was trying to save my my files.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Everything worked out last time to signify what it was I think I I got an era saying that my data frame is not defined. I think I'm just not something you must be missing out something first of all you need to have

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:22.000
assigned Santa L. Blue Defenseets Bracket Diamond tweeted up from Df. Did you draw this?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Oh, okay, okay. Oh, no, no, Thank you very much. If you have not assigned it, you can save it. .

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:37.000
You guys have so many questions that I want to move on let's just go on with Paula Jaco.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Okay, thank you, sir. sorry. So i've never been able to see this by you since that.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Okay, let me resend it. But please just pay attention to the window.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Now I I think it's exactly it was soon finished loading

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Okay, is there? Now, if you had any chat window, you should see.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Oh, yeah, i'm not on your phone it's like your phone.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
You will see

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Alright. So now let's do that how to load data sets from file onto a jupiter

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Alright to be able to do that. We use the Pundas function, c.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
As the He has the files E. Sv.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Files. Okay, So yeah. So we use that for Csv files.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:20.000
We use reads on desk, call, excel for excel.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Think so. Files Thanks. Xl: S: as the extension.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Okay, we use read on this call. Jason: Okay for the Jason files.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Okay, I I keep going on on. but let's just talk that because we're only going to walk with one today, which is read on that call.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Csv: So We're gonna learn how to do that it to be able to load any data from your profile.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:04.000
That's the point is imports on us ask pd right now we are using Pd.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:11.000
As an acronym for hundreds because let's visit when you when you start working as a data scientist.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So you didn't know this webinar you're gonna be typing lines and lines of statements, or could everything that seems you key strokes is a very useful thing.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:29.000
So Pd is going to be the alias we're going to use referred to partners whenever we want to call any of these functions.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:39.000
So once you've done that next thing you want to declare is the file name you want to import by a name you want to report in our case.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Our fire name is Demons 90 is that once one Dot Csv.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Alright. next thing you want is the path 5 parts that's where the file is told equals to you have to go figure where it is, but I I can get it from how I steve the file right?

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I see the file in. See what this? So this is my path.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:14.000
So copy this absolutely. Yeah. So that's my puff that's we are that Friday is probably new located in my computer in your own.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
You might be a different place, but always make sure you end with t 4 slash.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Alright bye

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:39.000
So now to import the file. i'll see food paths now this one going this step, these baby steps. it's just like you understand how we structure things identity. i'll do it with just one line and i'll show you so

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:52.000
full 5 plots. It goes to 5 5. Hello! Wow! name!

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:03.000
See, I see Prince full wow, and I run this. this is we are.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:12.000
My fight is located. You recognize that this string he's actually the same thing as this.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Are you guys? An accident

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Yes, hello, yes, But what i've done is try to help you see the the components that is the name of the file, and that is directly to the food of where in 5 is located.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Okay, So not that build on the standards. I can now see.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Loot the demo is file that will be i'll give the i'll be very, very good.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I'll go to the file, so I can call it data sets instead of using data free again.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:31:02.000
It does it is go to pd no i'm calling pandas, but i'm using pd i'm not gonna write pandas in full pd read on that's go see as the brackets in that

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:12.000
bracket i'm going to put the full pop to where the file is so for that i'll be using my full path.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Alright if I run that no arrow, which means that that data has come in.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:28.000
So now I can see print data sets

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
You see, volley, I have have my data now.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
So in this short step, you guys have learned how to load data.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So please, if you don't understand this speak now i'm more than happy to go right again.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
So that we all understand how to load the account, to educate.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Yeah. I tried loading mine. they have to say and put an arrow.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:17.000
It says, Name Dx is not defined. Yeah, Yeah, that when I want to load like when I want to save it.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
So, Cse: So if you are sending to Csv, you must have do that.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:29.000
You file us. Yeah, So I think this is line you Miss you don't have this line

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Oh, oh, you have to have the variable Df. food in the file first before you try to save it.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Okay, So I'll do that thank you sir.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Okay, so are we all comfortable, so far? Proof? We asked it.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Please, can you go to the first line of good? Yeah. Okay.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Thank you very much.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Okay, if I see after I write it report cbone, I I run this code ascend or gets on the score.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:29.000
No, you're not lucky that the sea ball has No, I mean as long as the data sets or something

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Okay, they said Okay. So

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:03.000
You get the government, it is. get on desk called data set, not gather.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:33.000
That was good. It does it on that's called Yeah, i'm lift you me out

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Okay, i'll be Laura if you have in trouble Please pick up.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Raji, Do you have any issues? Yes, my is giving me name.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Aero

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Ratio i'm not your name he's giving me name Arrow name Arrow.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:10.000
The month one is not defined and so name hello would be a function of how did what name did you call the file?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:23.000
You say, don't just use the good I sent you remove one from it right,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:33.000
We'll see as we so check this spelling because my studio Yeah. Check this planning.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Go ahead and tell you that at the then the name is different from what you have see.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Let me check you side, Raji, to be on the safe side.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Go to that script when you steve this you see that like when you deceiving Yes, just copy it onto a copy I'm bringing down here.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Okay, and using these optics, if you remove all of this.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Now i'm putting here make sure it's all in traditional Max.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:09.000
All right. I'm gonna put all this

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Oh, no, please combat any bubbles last and forward slash.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Very important is that. but i'll do that And and he's still shooting Samero.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:30.000
That's why they do exactly what I just asked you to do ,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Copy it, and then do I use it to import it back?

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Issue So let me change, because this is going to everybody.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Alright. so I I need to. I need to get some speak guys.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
So you now have learned how to lose data right let me just clean this up.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
You've learned how to do this and like I was trying to explain to you.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Each call in here represents the feature in our data.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
To correct is a feature of this don't come back to morality.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000
That colleagues, your language should be. That feature in my data, So current is a feature.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000
One call. this feature to me cover is feature 3, for all the way to Z.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
On the table. Now each rule of the data represents a sample.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:26.000
So our sample 0 sample, one sample, 2 all the way to sample.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And in my data, alright. So let me just make that note here for you guys.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Data frames matrices.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Okay, Thanks, Reggie. Okay, cause you know, data colleagues calls.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:26.000
He just, and it's our rules close. Samples Alright. So you guys should keep that in mind.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:34.000
The structure of auditory. Now, to find out the ship of your data free, for example, how many columns, How many rules do I have in the data you use?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:49.000
If functioning Pandas 2 gets the sheep. Oh, a data set Number V: just and samples.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Okay, So for that we're gonna use the functional code Df: Dot ship.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:07.000
But right now the name of my data center is my data sets that she

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Alright, so you just call it She tells you very clearly how many samples are, How many features like your data right now.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Are you guys? seeing my screen

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Yes, both, I see. Yes. Are you guys gonna see a screen

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Sample in this data, and 10 features in the sample.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.000
So that's what data does she does for you i'll teach you a few tricks going forward because these are tricks.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.000
You need to get Suppose I want to know what are the names of the columns in my data.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I don't have to go on out to the table, and then start seeing the names of the colleagues.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:03.000
If I want to get the names, so it gets of the features

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Okay, So i'll just see detailsets or whatever name you call your data dot com, Alright, if I call those questions you give me an like you list of all the calling of the names of the colors in my data are you guys seeing

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:27.000
that yes, Alright, I can also compat it to at least remember we thought you have to come back, you know a very good type.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Do you remember when we did it in Python?

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Yes, yes, problem welcome. Now you apply this concept to .

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:47.000
You can also see that all the things you mentioned, hey? just said, call him to.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:59.000
He lists. So so this will be calls are gonna call opposed to list in brackets.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Dick, does it? alright? So now if I Call print you see that it's going to be different calls.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.000
The presentation is now different from this other one.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Yes, and so I can each rate 3. This is in index of 0.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:28.000
This is a one. This is in 2 cases in 3, all the way to add, All right, so that can just be the right for you.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Call right. If I do that, I get that. so just use that account.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Yes, Paul, I can see raji's my name. that's good.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I'm happy for you all right so basically now I'm having i'm going to recap. i'm being all of you back again, just so that we're all on the same page this class is

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:19.000
very important when we started class today we talked about what we're going to provide this cost, and and I'm doing this for the stakeholders who are just joining we started by discussing

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:27.000
what we're going to provide in this course if I can just find my call points

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000
So we said, we're going to cover data opposition and data cleaning.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:43.000
We started data position already. you guys know this we're going to call our data position and data data transformation feature selection of feature engineering, Then all types of files on how to do them.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000
You know, into object under book things like the Csv.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Which we are already working with. don't excel the Jason, the pickle, the packet.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Okay, the text that's the txc we're gonna learn how to work with each of those 5 types.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:07.000
What's the going to have classes on sql you're gonna learn how to query sql data sets and extract things using select statements.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:22.000
We have losses, you know, and and then once we left all of these we're going to use that to now, carry out data cleaning Google and to end think data that is very dirty.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:34.000
What? through the process, to clean the data ready for either visualization or analytics. as a case, maybe remember the right that I said, If you learn nothing in this Academy, please focus on this first 3.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I need to be well with you. Okay, you will be forgiven if you don't know all 5 types all you know is that Csv.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Nobody will, you know. create your knowledge if you don't know Sql.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:53.000
You still survive as a data scientist I don't use Sql.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
In all my who work as a data scientist I don't use Sql.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:04.000
But we're teaching you because there is it's sort of emphasis on being able to create those data sets.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:13.000
And then mostly on this this is just end to end of items, one to 3.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Okay. So this introduction to Vice Park and Psychi Library for data processing is just deep.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Duringation of everything, you've learned from one to 3 so That's what we said.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:33.000
We're going to cover and we started he lost 15 things about data by taking our example of you walking in the ground, and the Md.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Or your manager is to want to build a model that will predict which employees or set of employees are likely to resign from our company in the next couple of years.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:50.000
So do the model that this is the probability in index, or any given employee.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Dropping off the employment of our business. you and I, all of us.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000
You have great storm to say, Okay, what kind of data do we need to make that kind of prediction?

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:10.000
And you guys were very you he ported it as you came up with all of these data types that we need.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000
What I did was talk them together to show you the relationship between each of them and what we're trying to predict.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:27.000
So essentially in data, science is you are more than in your relationship between a new, variable and an outcome.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.000
To see if changes in the outcome are predicted by that equal variable.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000
And I give you names for each of them for the outcome.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Variable. There are names you can use to refer to them.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Time we had dependent.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Just put that back. So we have dependent variable. Okay?

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
And then for the input variables we have independent, variable input, variable, you know.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Somebody give us a planetary variable that's fine features are then predictable variables.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Okay, So that's where we're coming from having understood the nature of the task that you did, and the Academy is asking for both, which is land the skills required to decide which features But I think that can be used or should

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:36.000
be useful during any given model we know went back so he let us start with the process of learning how to launch data onto, because until you loop it out you've done a book you haven't started

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:45.000
We said the 2, we need the primary 2 we need for this that's not true called not pipe or not depending on us.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Okay, if you ask you britain if a great is gonna tell you it's not the but we're not ready for that, because that's that one is for arizona vectors we're not ready for that

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:08.000
one. So the primary 2 we're gonna be using is pandas. So we put that on us, and that's the cool to be postponed us.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
But we need data to work with. So I mean it. detail the detail, or is it still good?

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Let us go to Cbn. because Simon, whose data we can work very easily.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
So we bought that Cbn: just be able to access this data.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000
The dataight holes, and I give you code to query Cpon to see all the data types it has.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:34.000
So that will give you it to speed out all the data tables that c.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
One is voting for you to get any of these dates out of all.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
All you need to do is call Sn or loop on desktop data set.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000
You know the name of the data, Let me show you and that's it to look it for you.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
But to be able to walk with the data once you look at.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:59.000
If you must assign this code to a variable cause, if they will need to go the data for you.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000
So some of you are trying to save it but you couldn't sleep it because you hadn't assigned it.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.000
So that's where you need this particular line of code so create the variable name in this case, Df.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:18.000
And then assign it that data that you are doing. And this gives that one state that once you do that, then you can have access to Df: I see.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Video, and you can do anything you want with this. So we included the detail.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:39.000
We have access to a demo data. Now, I will show you how to see any data frame or your dialogue back to file, and that's a good easy pandas good df dot 2, and that's called Csv if you're

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
submitting a Csv. which is the Dx extension.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Most Csv. in brackets. you put the full path to where the file is going to be received.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:53.000
In my case it was the C. drive inside, you see, drive workspace, folder and inside of food that you have my diamonds.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Data. But when you see your data this week, what part does does this combat the index call?

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.000
You see this index call you? That is not part of the data.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Bandas combats The index calling to call him in the time saves it for you sometimes.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:13.000
That's a lot of news ads you don't want it, unless the index means something to you.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000
So if you don't want the index to be seen just add another parameter to the save function.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Put it comma from the Directory to we are invisible with the come out the set index.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:30.000
It was support capital f not small at index that we web on that sees that data.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:36.000
You're gonna get the data with the index called the Monics.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:57.000
So now that we've learned how to do that data, what we're now doing is learning how to load that data back to our Csv file, which is lesson number one for me lesson number one for you guys Then how to load Ecsv.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
file from your full deployment group to be able to do that.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
The function I'm. going to use is the read on That's.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Called Csv. Function of Pandas. get 2 moving parts. You need to have to be able to load any file.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000
One is the full name of the file, with its extension.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Second is the full path or directory to the food that we are defined as part of the data to the 2 moving paths.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:33.000
You need to know the name of the file. the location of the file.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Now let me teach you a trick for those of you who might be struggling with this bus.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
You'll be like pro you did this but we don't know what you did.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:48.000
If you go to the food, that where the file is located in this case I want to bring in that one's one to get you the full path.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
If you are using windows 11. the problem is so for you already.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Just right. click the file and think copy us class please this is only if you're using windows 11.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:13.000
If you are windows, then i'll be doing by that, i'll show you how to do that one take copy as part when you've done that copy as path, just bring it back to your okay If you see what I listed

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
now it copied everything for me. Give me the full path.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:26.000
But I need to now change this to forward slash what's that all slots we find that use it Now it's ready to work.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.000
So if I see let's see df 2 is opposed to Pd.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:40.000
The reads. Oh, that's called csv brackets move that one and put these other brackets here.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Okay, So if I run this now it will load my data straight.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I run that now. I have Df: 2 of my data grabbing that down.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Yeah, i'll run it You see, I have the data. so that is one no, as you mean, you are using windows 10 below which most of you are starting.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Are using What you want to do is write the If file once you get to the full data file is right.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Click, the file, then click on properties click on practice.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:21.000
The window. We open this window. In that window there is an entry call location.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Location gives you where the file is thought you see this that's where the file is told.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Alright. if you go to details, you also see. So if you go easy to do yes, you see, probably.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Look. what you want to do is just come back to General and then copy the path.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:58.000
This is the past. so i'm gonna copy this i'll go to my let's see is the walls that alright no I've put it in bracket, because supposed to be a string.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:06.000
And I need to change the best bubble slash I've e 4 slash in the end.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
That's what I give you that I go back again.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.000
To. I go back again and then get the file name CD file in here.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Demo one. and you see that is that it both come back here, i'll see file.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Okay, because the properties approach doesn't give you the extension and then make sure you put it in quotation.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Max. So now i'm ready to read my file I can say D. F.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:53.000
3 is supposed to be the does read on that's called Csv team brackets at once.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Huh plus file name. Alright, if I run that oh, my read is not so low, right?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:19.000
So that's right again. Okay, do you see it goes i'm, not around this. I think we've experienced this problem in love with being Python.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.000
If you don't run this okay, you declare the variable before using it. What if I don't say to you?

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Not be fine, not defined, so most I didn't run a sell somewhere, so i'll go back and run this cell.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Not if I run it. No, I can't think this i'll bring it out.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Several ways of loading data onto your So this represents this: Get the okay.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Yes, said she. Okay, which simply is number. Oh, features ensembles.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:36.000
So this will be my how. you see, we just our position that she so like.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I said earlier. This tells me I have what time columns and 53,000 now, and 40 samples or rules in the data.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
No, I can also get the names of the call new city data.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I told you guys that just by saying, Okay, good Okay, so that'd be details, dot com my detail.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:24.000
I got combat. This to at least so I can walk with it if I need to. so i'll give it a name calls which means call use in my data is equals to list. i'm combating it to a list so I can access

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.000
them by the end expositions i've seen these assets right.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000
So at the end of these, if I say print calls, you see, I have these.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:45.000
So this was where we were now that we've got in this let us now see very simple ways of examining our data.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Very simple ways of examining our data under our test we can't do on at least that you see data sets.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Okay, let's let me annotate inspect the properties That's right of the features in the data.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Use using dot info. Okay, So we're gonna use that info to inspect the kind of properties of features our data as alright.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:26.000
So I'm going to write the code the idea 6 dot info.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Okay, at least obviously not info. Now, this is the summary table of the properties of our data.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And it's important that you guys learn to read this table right don't stop panic. it's very easy.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
It's like my friends from Zambia which is porridge. right?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Yeah, it is portrayed for those of you that you would say, is my mind It it is 5 1.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:04.000
So let's let's examine these 2 kitty study knows that the index reach which is the number of samples in our data.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.000
He's going from 0 to 5,339.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Okay, So in essence, we have 53,940 samples in our data.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:25.000
We have 10 volumes Then what you did those proceeds to do is stick each for you and give us the information about its content.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
This is each call in the data that is taken he's taking the Colorado.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:36.000
He studied us. How many records, or how many fields in that volume are not empty?

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Okay, You see, 53,940 out on dollar means all the species in that call you is for nothing.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:59:03.000
How you guys? Yes, 2. So if you are trying to find out if data is missing in any of the volumes of your data, I think that again, because of all, when all this you were trying to find out if you guys any

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:14.000
missing data in any of the volumes of your data sets They check this, but we are calling not at all.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Here is less than this. You know that they tight missing in that particular question.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:30.000
If if this number is it simple as this number here for any of the columns, it means that that calling is okay.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:38.000
We understand that? Yes, yes, sir, so that's what non, not okay.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:44.000
He wants to get out with this. No, no, no, not Is that enough? Which volume?

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:54.000
How many columns have they tying them? Okay, And then the did I, instead of the data type of the calling he said, to be flute.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:59.000
You guys already know what the flute is. Yes, cops.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Color and clarity are declared as objects strings.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Yes, So if I go back to that table let's go

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Thank you Alright, Evidently if I go back to that call to check this day columns so cops color and clarity.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:35.000
You can see they're not numbers. They are characters. they are Number They are not numerical, so we call them categorical variable is that category called variable.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:41.000
So now we may count that in you work that we need to work with. So let's think quickly.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Define it as we go. Okay.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Okay, So we'll see these dizza size that's not numbers.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:16.000
For example, States.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Hello!

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:28.000
What else? agenda

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Was that Okay, No. H. age, is it? No. number?

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Age is not an object. Alright, so. And if you look at these 3 columns code is describing.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Okay, look at the quality, if you like, of the diamond ideal premium. Good.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.000
So it's a categorical variable the same thing.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Clarity is so they are not numbers that category but the rest are numbers current is a flute, because it has 2 decimal places.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
That is, the flute table is the fluid pricing prices.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I need to do that prices that in Tj.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:20.000
X. one Z flute So Let's go back and check I see that price Is that N.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Tj: You see, that is that in but all the rest are fluid.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:32.000
We the exception of these 3? Okay, and this also.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.000
I like streams, so we call them categorical variables.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
So this is how you use this particular dot info. You have to see.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Okay, what kind of types are in my colleagues which fields are missing data, and which was not missing data in my in my table?

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:57.000
That is showing you how much memory they finally just do that he's taken 4.1 MB.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000
No, here's the advice are you guys with me ric are you here.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Yes, yes, Rebecca. Yeah, Aya Rica.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Now Rebecca in class is room. Echo.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Alright, I I Now here is a strong advice don't do.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Don't try to loot your data directly if you did massive data.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:38.000
If you see any data that is like, 20 MB, a 100 MB, you know a 1 GB or whatever.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Please don't go to something like this let me show you don't go see print.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000
They does it

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Because instantly you do it all the memory. in your computer you can see that it's more file. We just do that is already in 4 MB of memory.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000
So instead, the best way to load your data is, do what we call picking.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Add the data

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Using dot head. And do you right? That allows you to drop a few samples from the data.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
You don't need to see everything seeing it doesn't change anything.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:36.000
You just want to see a few samples. So say data sets Now, if you need it, without specifying how many rules or samples you want to need to return like that is going to give you only 5 rules. right?

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:41.000
So each returns 5 rooms. So this retails.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Bye Roosevelt.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Specify.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Alright. So this gives us 5 rules. However, if I want 20 rules.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:10.000
I can see data sets go ahead and i'll put 20 in that bracket.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Alright 20. So this will return 20 rovers

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Alright. so if I run it now, you can see, alright, 20 rules for me.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000
So this will recall the press, 5 rules or the first 20 rules.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Any data. Sometimes, for some reason you want to see the bottom part of the data, you want to see the lowest part of the data to see what is there for that user?

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Say, yeah, exactly. who said that? hey? mesa It's

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Go to you, returns the bottom rules

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
And you can specify any number you want for the past one.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:25.000
All you will. I I have a small question.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Alright.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Okay, So again, you guys have lens how to peek at the data.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:55.000
So it's more when I see peak means can you Luke

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Now, sometimes as the data site sometimes you're not just interested in your personal life, you just want look at the random return.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:22.000
So I can see data sets the sample Okay, the sample means not only grab any data for me, and you can't specify how many you want you to drop alright.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:29.000
So let me specify 10 drop any 10 samples round only for me.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:33.000
That's what this is doing are you guys with me so far.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Yes, sir, Okay, So we are good at the level of being able to inspect our data.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Any questions so far. let's go with at abc before we move on.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Okay, thank you, doctor. My question is, do we have some test groups, that awesome kind of text to activities, to prices under the nest boot camp?

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:10.000
That's a good question Yes, you will receive textbooks that you'll be working with next week is your self-paced learning.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:18.000
There'll be material for you to study Trust me and of course, there will also be a piece for you towards Thursday, Friday next week.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.000
That you have to write so that's how we track your performance across the program.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:29.000
You do yourself this study from Monday to Wednesday by Thursday morning.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
He's done that time. so he's only calling your country, and then sees money in our subject.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:43.000
He does and then you have a whole day to at least get the wisdom.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:09:10.000
So? yes, Louis, How do you

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Which is not, begins to look

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:27.000
With that still comes here Yeah. and we okay.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:39.000
So muted himself alright. Well, I think so. thank you very much.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.000
But please, who don't messy with is able to speak now alright.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.000
My question is that and assume you we are in mixing.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Then how come we know the actual Go along? but as a as we do have what it makes them value, maybe a mixing and value from one of our Coulombs.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Now

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Yes, yeah. So that's what the info does for you does infrastructure.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Very glad. So is this for correct Right now Carl has no missing values costs.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.000
You see the the this sales are full, so any any line?

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
We are the number here that is not the same thing as this.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Study simply means that they are missing values and and that's name of they call it that Tpu price.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
So you can get it from here. Yeah, all that methods.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:47.000
But this is the Okay. So so basically this data looks through.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Yeah, these data, as far as we see, values that concern.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:55.000
But I will use the work clean. as far as missing values that concern this data is complete.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:05.000
The are not missing values. So if I do something like this and this is not for today's class, But you know just so that you guys can have something to choose.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Okay, if I see details that is any that's not and I run this.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:27.000
This tells me which column has missing values on which one doesn't are you guys with me So far?

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah. alright. but this is it is that We're going to go to later.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:44.000
So this is just checking so good to the in our data.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Alright soon. Now we've we've we've learned we've learned how to do that later.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Let's see now how to play around with the data okay i'm out of time.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.000
But I'm going to run * minutes. Do I have your permission to do that.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Yes, yes, sir; but please do. you have your permission to use it?

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:20.000
So yeah, do the the person on there to add to that.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Tell me what the other person else about might be missing values.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.000
And maybe we see species, and so on I think he's talking about it.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:48.000
But my main question nice. I want to make an appeal like for the is it possible for the school dice institution to just?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:13:01.000
We're giving us meaning together with the people who don't constantly use it for me.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.000
I'm talking best now for myself. but I don't understand you use Okay?

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Well, that's I understand what You're saying the The beautiful thing is, we are quitting in python here, so everything So you'll find that you're about to use it.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Just watch the next 10 min and see what happens Okay, you're not going to marry me. Anything I promise you that. now, please.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I just bought 50 min from you guys. Let me use it.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I see that So let me just use that 50 min, and then I come back to you.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Now data frames can be sliced and dized very easily.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:49.000
So remember that if you look at that data set and i'm just going to change its name, because I don't want to be writing the i'll just what I'm. doing is assigning, whatever that data set is voting to

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Df: So that now it's easy for me let me add up X to it, just to that it doesn't complete any of the data we have before.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.000
So I run this. so now I have my Dfs.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.000
If I want to get look at my data sets.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I can't do a lot of things for my data set very easy.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:19.000
So let's see filtering sorry

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Obtaining getting one call. you already know the names of my data data are calling right?

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:40.000
So if I call calls here, Okay, my call calls. These are the names of my data.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:48.000
If I want to extract your this calling from my data good.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Only the Kara got it. That would be the name of the data.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Dfx. Square Brackets

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:08.000
This will now be just that colleague I can Assign it to a variable let's say car up.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Call him is. it was to that. So I can run that now.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
I have access to just that calling I can do this that's my cut off.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Course you might not recognize that as a car call you but let's change it to color, so that we can now let's do a cost.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:36.000
I changes the cost, calling alright and changes to 2 costs just that you can see.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:45.000
So iron this cost. So if I run that am I right this can see that I've got to use the cost calling.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Oh, my detail! Are you guys with me so far? Yes, sir. no.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:59.000
I can determine how many unique labels I have in that column each of these entries are labels, so let's say, get unique levels.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:16.000
So It's unique. Number of the bills and the calls calling That will be, and I'm going to use another route before you think so.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:28.000
That would be Df. x those costs that's unique

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:41.000
If I run that, I see that how many uniquely bills we have in that colleague 3, 4, 5, oh, 5, bye, so very easy!

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:51.000
I can see that there are 5. Now, this technique is always important, because if I have, you see me, there are arrows in the names, because I might see premium and see other premiums, though differently.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Sometimes in the data. you guys are going to encounter as we begin to walk in your next room.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Plus. this is the makeup class for you guys right who didn't know you guys you don't last next week? is your service study.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000
So this is how you How do you implement this code using another record?

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:28.000
This will not be dfx square brackets cost that's unique

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I'm still getting the same thing right Yes, pro so it's either I reference the callium v. is in the text position.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000
That's what this is. This is by Index position.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Oh, I reference it by its name. any other methods will work, But this method doesn't work, you guys is space in the name of the variable, for example, very good.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:18:01.000
You see? Very good. Oh, no, very good we don't have the recording name that has the 2 words in it, so we can illustrate that.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:06.000
So your cpus bet is always to use the second method, because, regardless of how the name is E.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:13.000
To rob Alright, So now let me ask you a question.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Suppose I want to fill out all the records in this data.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000
We have caught people go to premium how do I go about it.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:27.000
So let's see challenge

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Get all the samples. Okay.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:51.000
We have cops is. Oh, the bill premium Now this is going to be a little bit tricky, so he doesn't mean hard.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.000
It means you just have to get a little bit of attention.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:09.000
So this is get to Oh, samples! Oh, damon samples that's our premium

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:22.000
This will be that's called a premium email samples it was through Df.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:35.000
X dot location. i'm going by location dot location square brackets it will be dfx.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:43.000
We're basically again, my fx square brackets I want to feel that by the cost call you all right.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And this will be webcode volume is equal to email.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Again, let me explain the code defiance I want to extract from our data.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:02.000
See these are data here that has all kinds of where's It again. yeah.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:07.000
These are our data where we have all kinds of demons, ideal premium, good and all of that.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:11.000
I want to filter out only the premium diamond.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
From this table of 53,000 or 59,000 samples.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:24.000
To do that I will use the function in python known as the location. sorry Pandas, known as the location of the Lc.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:30.000
So it would be the name of the data frame, which in my case is Dfx Dot location loc.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Then in bracket, I could be conditioned for the first 3.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:40.000
So my conditional Vfx cool. Where about they call you? Is it both of premium?

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:46.000
So let's run that 2,000 on so Now if I take premium and try to print it out.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:53.000
You will see that premium should only contain samples that are okay.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I think my spending of Pm. is wrong do you think I'd be Yeah.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:02.000
So you couldn't feel that in anything so let's change the P.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:08.000
So we'll run it. Now you can see that these are all premiums, and all together.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I have 13,791 samples.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Now who can run to Alpha all the samples that are very good?

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Who got those Ridiculous is the only place with.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:43.000
How about the how many students in this last day? I have 63.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Okay, let's go with okay.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:22:04.000
So okay, So we'll Go with very good very good samples.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Very good samples is called zoom. Yeah. very good samples.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Then Df: X Yeah. fx dogs Okay, Okay, that's efx.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Yes, and then almost and

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:54.000
What is it called up? no it's not very.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.000
It's not very good. The name of the calling That's All you need .

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Okay, Okay, So That's good, for this class. when you end your python class it's okay to say double post.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:32.000
In this class. Now, whenever I want to use this okay, All right, then, to go to Okay, alright.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.000
So what do you want to put now? So with how very good!

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:49.000
The very good.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Yeah, i'm running it for you and he run without an arrow so let's print it out.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:03.000
So very good. You did. Well, no, yes, it tricky to be able to build up for us.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:09.000
We are, you know, all the items in this table we are.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:18.000
The price is greater than $300

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Mandy. So okay, okay, body face let's go into you the cool one.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Let's go ahead alright. Oh, okay, I will give it i'll give you.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:57.000
I'll give you i'll give the variable name to be fries It's done market price 300.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Okay, Basic Question: Yeah, Thanks. Dfx: : Dot: Hello.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Square brackets. Yep, Thanks.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I'm about to help him

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Then the column is price. Okay, Okay, have a problem right now.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:14.000
But let's continue listen

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Don't know No, don't price to a string so what do you think is the problem?

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Price 2, 3. So if we check now let's see how many, yeah, it's nothing.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Video 300 another rice let that's the let's see 3

02:26:49.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Oh, we have let's put like maybe 5 phone right down here

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Okay, So we have something here. Yes. Now, when you see, we got just 200, Okay.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.000
So now let me teach you a lot to get the maximum value.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:34.000
And now we did last lesson. We close

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:42.000
So this will be df the price

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Right so that's my Maximum value you guys need so far.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:28:09.000
That's right, okay, i'm sorry if those prize does mean

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:13.000
You can also get mean. you can get that mean if you want.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Okay, so month. Okay, guys who've been summary today and i'm happy where we go to today.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:32.000
I think you guys have that's not the good speed what would we do today is give you what I thought was a gentle introduction, but I think you got a little bit But always.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Say we give you gentle introduction to pandas today.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:44.000
The lessons we've learned today one how to load data and how to save data.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Okay, to drive. We launched that one we went saved, and we do that back, included that data. Let me go to the very beginning of my screen.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Once we do that it that we went ahead to start cutting out some inspections of the data.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000
There are some buonosis we had around the way like How do you see bond to access sample data?

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:16.000
So i'm not going to count that as part of our call It's just a good news lesson, but our call learning is we learned how to be able to load that data from file on save it but once we

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:22.000
launched that went ahead to inspect the structure of our data by calling the ship so.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:28.000
But she helps us understand the dimensions of our data. So we know what we're dealing with, and the size of the data.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:34.000
This is quite a big data between 3,000 We also learned how to extract the names of the columns of the data.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I put it in a list. so it's more if I Tell you you know, creating lists and look through the contents of each call.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.000
You might get the lens of the call you that's an Ecpc.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Cool. i'm gonna write it just before we close but if I simply get the length of each calling in your data implement it small code to get the missing values.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:01.000
You should go to do that. Then we learned how to slice our data.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Okay, and by slicing data i'm talking about being able, Okay, before we learn about license, we let out to use that info to inspect the properties of our data.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:16.000
For example, the data types, and if they are missing by using our data, we launch that.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.000
I also told those that are cool way to determine missing values in the data using dot com.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:33.000
So you guys love that, and Then what I don't say learning how to extract calling using the data how to get one calling without stops. how to get

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:43.000
It's subset of the data or of the data based on some conditions, you learn how to do that, using the dialogue alright.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:54.000
After that I just we didn't taught us how to get it maximum. I mean more values because when we're trying to filter, we have any problem determining what was the range of the kind that calling So whenver you run into

02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:06.000
that pro that way you're trying to tell me what's the email maximum value that's call you just use the meeting on the call that will give it to you Now let me run it code, and this is just something you

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:14.000
should practice. i'm not the next minute. i'm just going to run it and at the end of class today. I'll spend probably 5 min listening to anybody who wants to ask a question.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:27.000
So i'll see you calls is it goes to dfx calling

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:32.000
No 2 at least.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Phone calls. Oh, cool calls. I missed it here. then. detail.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Len then Dfx. So that gives me the length of my data.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:32:11.000
So now I'm going to move through each column for calls Eve Lenn brackets Dfx Okay.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:19.000
He's less done that's all in

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:26.000
If is equal to

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:41.000
This is that's something the is important to

02:32:41.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Minus 9 the fx wherever I get call so i'll see Prince Brackets

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:08.000
That's that's

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Number.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Of course, we're gonna be getting 0 0 from this data when we're done.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:22.000
But that's fine. So let me run this good now but before I run it.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:36.000
I'm going to say call this is he's missing.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Do So that's it. So let me run this so this conditional is is not going to be met.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Because yeah, let me see same value. So let me add on L statement so that we can see else So you know.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Okay, let me give us 3 days weeks. A very simple example.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Bye, bye. Yes, that's what I wanted to quickly do. but I want to.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:18.000
I don't want anybody asking me who

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
I don't want to have what you say Oh, please explain that Good!

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:27.000
How did you run it? not today, we're out of time So they do my data.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:32.000
And those ,

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Okay, So

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Okay, so let me see if this is

02:34:52.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Alright. So Let's go back and so yeah we're just going to import our data now, so we'll see the fi is people also Pd.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:11.000
That reads on that's called csv in brackets is going to be in my drive C.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Pull on forward slash workspace slash damn it was plus that's Csv. Alright.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:35.000
So this will not be Dfi Yeah, I Dfi.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Alright, so that's why, that's yeah so my else look else. frames print not bring No, I don't just rushing.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Thank you.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:16.000
So it's not finding any data is just because we are using there.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:26.000
So the code is working basically, but for some reason,

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:43.000
So let's do one thing here that ones one that's it's an a that's fine

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Or Adefi. Yeah. So this is the .

02:36:51.000 --> 02:37:08.000
The one I just walked on. Okay with missing data. Okay, So let let me use the defense up, which then let's see. missing right?

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Dfi does it's that's all alright.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:38.000
So i'm using like so for call come on right and Zip

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Calls.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Did you? Did you guys the function in python?

02:37:53.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Yes, sir. yes, okay, yes. You thought to yourself, Okay, So this will be.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Evere is greater than 0. Now just get that up from 0

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Alright. we don't need a deep call them anymore.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:17.000
That there is

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:25.000
Depot. let's done that you're right

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Prince. Okay. this will be wreck Okay, So run that good.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:44.000
So it's not working you guys, see that Yes, sir, so applied the is missing.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:53.000
This data that is missing that data that is within that data. Now that this is walking, I can reduce this to a function.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Remember we taught you guys function so that you can see that everything in you land still useful.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:03.000
So this is just bonus, so that next week at Abc can be very busy.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Yeah.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Is that Abc: there? So bus

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Finally.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Off your Michael this off your mic. We are in injury time of your mind.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Alright. so i'm gonna in densities. in So now the application function, let me show you So we get the data sets.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:53.000
The first one to do is get the Okay. So now let me send it to you to Dfi.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:40:01.000
He's got your data set Alright. still no I get that assigned to Dfi.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I get. according to the data, I compute the missing values in the data.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.000
I get it length of the data which I right now do not need for that's fine.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Then I looks through the columns and the records.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:19.000
I find out what is missing Once that is done.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:35.000
I will see append so let's have the yourself yeah let's call this me seeing reports .

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:49.000
So at this point i'll see if that is there missing don't append brackets

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Zoom, information.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:13.000
And this now, with missing reports that's append will be brackets need to be all this information.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:24.000
The user report up it's not complete is it this one yes, you just do that.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:29.000
You don't have any big English coming from this could run around it.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Okay, So this is fine. Now, at the end of the day all I want remember we told you about it on statements.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:41.000
All I want is for this to return. Alright, are you guys with me?

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Yes, let's run this and see if it was just by calling this function passing into our data sets what's our data?

02:41:52.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Set dfi right so we're gonna pass dfi to this Dfi run that see that Now this printing I'm getting here.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:12.000
This line is because of this print spring. so let me mute the brings alright.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:17.000
So meet the brains out on that function again now when I run the code.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:22.000
So now I have you very possible tools to check for missing values, regardless of the data.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Are you guys with me so far? Yes, both. So anytime anybody gives you data.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:34.000
You got pull out this your function wherever I keep It i'm, passing it out with outcomes.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.000
This interesting results. So we're going to be learning a lot of how to do this stuff right?

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:43.000
I don't we're done with this academy you'll be robust data around us.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:49.000
All right. So class is done for today. I promise to make sure we upload this for you guys.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:55.000
Tonight, please. Tonight is Is that time so don't go check 10 Pm.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:00.000
You're like these guys I want to do this okay alright.

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Thanks, guys, I hope you this class was useful for you guys.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Very well. Are you from the shopping

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Okay, So we would look material onto your

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Thank you so much.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Okay, but let me see it again. for you guys.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Friday next week, you have a Greece right It's not Steve to worry about really You will enjoy it when you see okay Thanks.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Again, guys, and see you next next time when we support night.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:19.000
I thought you have a question. Yes, sir, I have a question okay I don't know.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Maybe you can just help me out. Hello, sir. Can you hear me?

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Okay, So I I you can help me on Screw Hope where we are in the in the data set the info method.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:41.000
So I want to. I want to find out. Additives said I. did.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Pro proper data type. And if okay, just have me on screw.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Yeah, we have the Yes, yes. Now, seeing this information about the data set.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Now want to find out the data set. Are they in the proper data type?

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:14.000
What if the data are not or let's see a column? for example, we already have a 200 correct to be a flute?

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.000
What if Karat is into into either, or in that, as an integer?

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Can it be converted to demands the the change in type when we get there.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Okay, Okay, we'll get you how to change the data type.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Once we start working we did it. there you can always change from floats to integer.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Sometimes you might even use this stream, but meanwhile they are numbers.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:50.000
There are Okay, Okay, Alright, Thank you very much, sir.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:56.000
No problem. good time.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.000
If you need to go classes over, please.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Stella. Okay, for about it's like a question I appreciate you for what you're doing, and I've I was.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:16.000
I was so like Oh, you are here, you know.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:22.000
But was so. You will never answer the in parts of making. I wish there.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Thank you. Thanks so much for Oh, thanks, thanks. Thanks so much.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:41.000
,

02:46:41.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Nothing is too small. project. you said Okay, I think by here wait one ,

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:14.000
I can hear you. Yeah, I said, I did format the name format of the file.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:36.000
We also meeting the Academic, but one company because I've already put in one composite, So I don't know if i'm wrong, you don't have a problem name will not be reason for any

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:52.000
John and Mecca, do you have a question

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:59.000
Yeah, ,

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Music you're doing is specific, John and Mccarthy, Do you have the Question let's move on from John

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Yes. So yes. okay.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:47.000
And where? do you have a question?

02:48:47.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Oh, please, i'm sorry. Hello, alright

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:18.000
That is this. i'm questioning Okay, I will understand you come back here.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Yeah.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:29.000
,

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:43.000
I'm, assuming that? we Just see What's that?

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Why I switch was because it will get me to a topic that you want to go into.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.000
You know, at that point, so I use the simpler way to go about it later.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Would you recommend that code using any different methods so that's what I've done Now, if you're seeing your network affected your ability to follow the class, please just watch the video you'll get the same value alright let's go with

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Joshua or Larry Day. So yes, Joshua

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Just right any kind. Yeah, I don't know what the city network basically

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Just so I need 98,

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:36.000
And go on speaking. Let me see Oh, is it a lot better now?

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Yeah, alright. So how many questions might they put this submission?

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Right. so. some said the submitted aliab or did not go in the meal to join the dictator around me couldn't.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:52.000
I don't know if that is whole for this is name you would be.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Some meals should be sent. So there are 3 things happening here.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Meals have been sent to all those who submitted on this project.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Some bills are bouncing back. did that Because because emails are not properly written.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:15.000
Oh, maybe yeah, guys are. overlude in our gateway in terms of pushing those males because it's not just that mute, as you know.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Maybe it's going to work so maybe this summer was a value that I was shedding.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:41.000
People have what you need them, taking care of it.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:45.000
But we do want to keep holding you guys while all of these plays out.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:52.000
So since we already have, like 95 close to sense, people sorted out, we have to get you academic going.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Okay, Okay, So any person believe this for me that project they have no receive feedback on that project as in the way tools to fall back into an they can't challenge that they're just right And say Well, I So we did my project

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Why have I been asked to go somewhere else, and we will deal with that.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Okay, Okay, So thank you, sir. alright. Okay, guys let's.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:25.000
This is, let's lose at this point John you see wanted to ask your question.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:41.000
So Yeah. how are you? Hello, I Don't. is the top one?

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:52.000
I can hear you, I said. I thought they'd be they they even missed this afternoon.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:53:01.000
I almost use the metro we see I don't know if I can get the recording of I thought of this natural.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Yeah, that's what we said. We said you recordings for this class is gonna be uploaded.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:12.000
I I made the commitment to make sure it's recorded. at least today, no no matter how late.

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:17.000
But I also put in a copy of that 12 midnight here is like 5 P. M.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:21.000
For most of you all 7 here for some of you, if you need you here.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:28.000
So. don't go to bed at 10 pmc in our prophet.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:34.000
Just go to bed when you make up your seats. Okay, hi, guys.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:39.000
I got a who I have have stop at 11 here, and it's 2 min to that time.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Okay, So thanks for coming. I hope you had a good time today.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:48.000
But please practice this practice once you get your materials all right, trying to go to my problem.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Thank you very much. Thank you. yeah, as these things.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:10.000
Yeah, Thank you. Thank you. Bro: Yeah. Thank you.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Sandals.
