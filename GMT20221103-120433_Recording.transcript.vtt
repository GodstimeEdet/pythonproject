1
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.940
Stanley Omeike: Oh,

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:25.500
Stanley Omeike: one of the basic assumptions we make once you get to this Academy is that you have the foundational understanding of fights. And So if you're given a task in Python, you will basically know how to go about the basic tasks that you may not be unexpected. And also don't worry

3
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:44.129
Stanley Omeike: if you feel that your python is not robust or strong enough yet nothing to worry about. But you should worry if you don't know the basic you simple by You can write variables, you can write expressions. You don't know what containers are. You can't even write it, function, and all of that. If you don't

4
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:55.149
Stanley Omeike: still understand the basic stuff. You might be challenging for you in this class because we're not teaching python in this class we are rather using python to get stuff done.

5
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:08.590
Stanley Omeike: So once again. Your welcome uh today I promise to be gentle, so i'm not going to do. We're going to do stuff for sure. But uh, it's not going to be any heavy lifting that will um for you.

6
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.109
Stanley Omeike: The school is still there.

7
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:30.000
Stanley Omeike: I expect that by the end of December getting into first of of January. You should be done with this academic, and you should be getting ready to uh again once again to have any projects

8
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.080
Stanley Omeike: complete the project. And then, you know, we want to be that in so

9
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.149
Stanley Omeike: as required. So let me just share my screen,

10
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.059
Stanley Omeike: and then we can see uh,

11
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.100
Stanley Omeike: okay, what this program will cover

12
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.649
Stanley Omeike: at this time. You don't, please. Uh, mute your the

13
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.170
Godstime Edet: Oh,

14
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.399
Stanley Omeike: so Can you guys see my screen?

15
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.860
Samson Ikuenayo: Yes, sir,

16
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.039
Stanley Omeike: All right. Um. Just

17
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.400
Stanley Omeike: one final check, to be sure.

18
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:57.099
Stanley Omeike: Um. So basically in this, in this uh data, we're going to be covering these topics. Okay, and they're very important topics. Um, regardless of which direction you're going. Data, analytics, data, science so much. And then these topics are very important. Um. We've been recovering

19
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.760
Stanley Omeike: data, acquisition and data cleaning

20
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:14.959
Stanley Omeike: uh, in this class uh, or during this academic and the two we're going to be using to do that is called Panda. We're going to be using Pandas for data.

21
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:25.629
Stanley Omeike: We also then how to uh transform data, how to clean the data and and transform the data to get features out of the data. Let me back up with a bit of explain a few things to you guys.

22
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Stanley Omeike: Who is this that will not stay muted

23
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.390
Stanley Omeike: guys, Please just um check your device and be sure you unmute it. Okay, that way. It helps me stay focused.

24
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.590
Thanks.

25
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.770
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So uh

26
00:03:50.300 --> 00:04:08.590
Stanley Omeike: you've spent about maybe a couple of months or week uh lending how to use python. But that's just the beginning of the journey. Part of what you do in detail now is you're good in data, analytics, data, science of machine learning is. You always start with the challenge of finding data or whatever what you need to do

27
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.060
Stanley Omeike: for those of you who have done it, there will be no statistics and probability. One of the rules in statistics is that.

28
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:25.290
Stanley Omeike: But sometimes, if you are not careful with the details, for, like you, Don't, randomize properly when drawing a sample from a data, you might end up with data that is skewed to the left or skew to the right, as the case. Maybe we'll discuss these concepts as we go, But i'm just giving you Guys basic foundation of why we need to clean our data out prep for mother.

29
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.520
Stanley Omeike: So data cleaning is a very important step.

30
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:43.669
Stanley Omeike: In fact, it is so important that I can tell you confidently that as a data analyst or a data scientist or a machine learning engineer, seventy percent of your time, at least seventy percent of your time will be spent doing data wrongly.

31
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:56.940
Stanley Omeike: It We spend trying to clean the data, trying to get the details we form that allows you to get the highly accurate model, and today is the third of November, some of your drawing block, as i'm saying this

32
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:07.629
Stanley Omeike: uh hopefully, by now we get to the third of January you'd be like, Oh, yeah, I get it. I get it so again. Don't worry. You don't understand what i'm saying right now. It will come to you as we work.

33
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.509
Stanley Omeike: Now, once we clean our data, we need to transform the data,

34
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.889
Stanley Omeike: and you're going to lend it that transformation and all the tools we use for that transformation. When we get there,

35
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:32.189
Stanley Omeike: then we have to lend feature selection, because it is not every feature in our days uh that is contribution value to our model. Some features are done with. Yeah, just they are not contributing to anything. Other features in the data are noisy.

36
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.739
Stanley Omeike: Okay, let me give you an example.

37
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:54.650
Stanley Omeike: Let's say you work in a particular company, and the Md. Or your manager comes out, say, Oh, you've been in one compost for some months learning data analytics. Can you give us a model that can help predict uh when employees are likely going to leave our employment? Okay, uh bill doesn't matter to you.

38
00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:12.949
Stanley Omeike: The level of motivation in employees, I'm pretty sure is likely to be in the next two years. Also in the we can build such a model. It's not a problem. Now you guys start collecting data. What kind of features do you think might be required to do the model that predicts that employee would need your organization or not. I need you guys to implement.

39
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:22.860
Stanley Omeike: What kind of data should we be collecting if we want to figure out which employee is likely to be the company uh sometime in the future. Raise your hand if you have an answer,

40
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:33.529
Stanley Omeike: what kind of data? And I'm going to just write just so that you guys can understand what we need by the concept of noisy data. Okay,

41
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.720
Stanley Omeike: employee.

42
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.230
Okay.

43
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.100
Stanley Omeike: So let me go with.

44
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.849
Stanley Omeike: Okay, Govin: I'm: not hearing you. You are muted.

45
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.880
Godwin Ubogun: What are you for,

46
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.739
Stanley Omeike: Hey, Gordon? How are you doing?

47
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.800
Godwin Ubogun: Hi:

48

Uh, let's see.

94
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:51.210
Stanley Omeike: All right. Uh right now. I'm just gonna take from one more person. And then uh, we'll kind of uh rule on

95
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.820
Stanley Omeike: uh is this class full of males? I don't know females in this class.

96
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.930
Stanley Omeike: Um,

97

Stanley Omeike: hey, ladies, rise up to the task.

98
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.780
Stanley Omeike: Not let these guys join your course.

99
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:20.340
Busola Adedoyin: I think they've said it all, or you can. The partners include um when employee was um debate of employment.

100
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:29.270
Stanley Omeike: That's that's the that's what we have. Yeah, the of employment.

101
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.200
OMONEDO OGHENERO GIFT: Good afternoon for

102

Stanley Omeike: Yes,

117
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.780
Gavin Abiamuwe: Can I? Can. I ask something?

118
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.779
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, that's why it's up to you just right.

119
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:24.560
Gavin Abiamuwe: Okay, I I think the work, the working environment counts

120
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:37.669
Gavin Abiamuwe: the possibility for boot and development. Okay, uh, thank you very much. Uh prospect.

121
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.159
Stanley Omeike: And there Okay, uh, um, Someone said, experience.

122
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:52.299
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So so guys, let's let's. This is fine

123
00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.920
Stanley Omeike: relevant skills. Okay, relevant skills. Okay, Which is part of experience.

124
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:19.439
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So now let's assume that all of us and I, I, you guys for contributing this. Let's assume that we have decided that these uh, all those that contribute or potentially contribute to an employees. Um,

125
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.430
Stanley Omeike: okay, stay with me, guys as I do. This is um.

126
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.230
Stanley Omeike: Alright, take this

127
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.720
Stanley Omeike: and

128
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.409
Stanley Omeike: I do that

129
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:57.550
Stanley Omeike: and get down if it's. And I, you know, put this on that here. I might have to reduce the sizes of distance a little bit. Okay, So you guys will be able to see after I do that.

130
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:10.480
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So these are all the we've identified that potentially contributes to our employees uh

131
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.390
Stanley Omeike: um

132
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:20.099
Stanley Omeike: tendency to leave the organization. So if I install something here and I call this uh

133
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.380
Stanley Omeike: employee

134
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.560
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, something like that,

135
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.109
Stanley Omeike: I I decided to put this in a box.

136
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.889
Stanley Omeike: Let's send our books back.

137
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.819
Stanley Omeike: Uh make sure it doesn't have a call up.

138
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.300
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So we have this box. Now,

139
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:59.109
Stanley Omeike: essentially what we are. See by virtue of this was all the data we collected that we uh intended to use it for more than it. What we're seeing is that all these factors that we identified here. Okay, and send this to the back

140
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.899
Stanley Omeike: uh. So

141
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:21.000
Stanley Omeike: okay, something like, we said that all these factors contribute to employee attrition, and when we start building a model, or when we start trying to do analysis. What we're testing for is the relationship, the strength of the relationship

142
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:29.960
Stanley Omeike: uh between each of these variables that we have here and observed reach of employee applications. We're going to take employee.

143
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.080
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

144
00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.860
Stanley Omeike: Now you already have the

145
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:12.850
Stanley Omeike: we do. Yeah. But tell me, what do you think the name of an employee, and how long he will stay in an organization?

146
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.560
Dexter Emmanuel: No,

147
00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:31.060
Stanley Omeike: no! So that feature called name of employee is a useless, variable right, because it is useless to the extent that a change in name of the employee does not result in any. You can change in the

148
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.070
Stanley Omeike: Oh, that's it for you

149
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:26.170
Stanley Omeike: Now we'll take employee Id and try to regress it against the employee.

150
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.769
Stanley Omeike: What we are trying to figure out is as the of employees.

151
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.049
Stanley Omeike: My answer will be, maybe. Do you know why? My,

152
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.720
Raji Azeez: No.

153
00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:56.130
Stanley Omeike: The reason why my maybe, is that sometimes employee ids are not Toronto.

154
00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:12.990
Stanley Omeike: Okay, In some organizations that have geographic uh distribution of their facilities, they might have ids, employee ids that associate employees is not in branches or something geographical locations, or something countries. Do you know that?

155
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:28.070
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, they? For if it in particular branch, let's see the bank and the bank has, you know, in one hundred branches across the world and the branch in C. N. Nigeria there, and

156
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:45.579
Stanley Omeike: the ids of employees that work in that branch are unique to that branch. Okay, the identifiers are. You need to that branch and the two for all the other branches across the world. If the branch manager in Nigeria operates a toxic environment.

157
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.410
Raji Azeez: Yes, that's true. Yeah, agree with me.

158
00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:08.309
Stanley Omeike: Yes. So therefore I will not in a very free way employee. Id because you might tell me something. Okay on on this. I've been to that.

159
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:32.790
Stanley Omeike: There, we can hold that now. Sometimes Ids And and this is where i'm trying to clean you guys to be sensitive in terms of how you can see that information from data on features. Sometimes Ids can be tied to gender. Ids can be tied to position in the organization. Do you guys recognize that?

160
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:44.439
Stanley Omeike: Yes, in some organizations they have a senior staff. They have genuine stuff. They have uh executive level and the Ids uh have identified. As for that,

161
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:51.280
Stanley Omeike: if that habits, what you might find is that employee attrition might be influenced,

162
00:22:52.020 --> 00:23:13.399
Stanley Omeike: not because of the Id really we call it Covariance. We call it Covariance. The what is happening is because the employees who leave the organization are mostly those in See the um middle management, for example, and the Ids for those senior level stuff are almost the same with identifiers. You find that those category of Ids have a higher tradition rate

163
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:44.530
Samson Ikuenayo: it's. It's also related to the dates of employment.

164
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:24.580
Stanley Omeike: That is what we call bandwidth. In fact, we are in particular a bunch of employees have a certain orientation of behavior as they move through this system, so I think they they remain cohesive as they go. So you then see the actually not in Ids or any other way that they can be identified as a cluster.

165
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:37.930
Stanley Omeike: Alright, So uh, I will not, really. Id or do I investigate it properly. So that's what Peter Rambling will help me figure out if Id is contributing to uh, okay employee.

166
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:53.709
Stanley Omeike: So let's take another one. Uh i'm gonna take you of employment. Now, if we take you of employment, we also see in the organization that it is possible that the year we employed our employees affect their attitude to what What do you guys think?

167
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:48.380
Stanley Omeike: If that is true, it is, You have what we call

168
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.980
Stanley Omeike: that is defined by groups of employees that came into the organization. At the same time,

169
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:05.319
Stanley Omeike: if that happens, you're going to likely see that you of employment is affecting employee at

170
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.009
Stanley Omeike: it is just that of employees that share a common identity.

171
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.870
Stanley Omeike: Are we together?

172
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:27.720
Stanley Omeike: We will teach you a concept, and I need you to write this down somewhere. So when we get there, you know we got there. We teach a concept called Multi-colinearity.

173
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:36.229
Stanley Omeike: He's right. I'm a wait wait for me for you to write it, because somebody wants me to

174
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:49.609
Stanley Omeike: multi cool linearity. So let me.

175
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.800
Stanley Omeike: You'll see multiple variables uh

176
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:15.229
Stanley Omeike: Colinia having the same, the same regressive relationship between themselves and an outcome. Variable. Alright, so. But just we're not discussing it today because it's It's a big work. We're going to complete when we're ready.

177
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:31.420
Stanley Omeike: Okay, so uh, I can continue But I don't want to spend all my time on this table hopefully. You are able to understand that as we go through each of these features, some of them contribute. Some of them will not contribute. Is that true?

178
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:42.309
Stanley Omeike: By the time we finish our data, rambling and data cleaning, it is possible that we might only end up with six or seven of these features, as it features that

179
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:59.900
Stanley Omeike: now the we used to do it. It's not hand in the mouth, in the to figure out if it particular variable is contributed or not.

180
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:16.949
Stanley Omeike: So what you and I have been doing for the past twenty minutes, he's not the way we go about doing this. Otherwise you don't need to be in this class. You can use your common sense to figure out what contributes and what does not we have tools that we use to do it, And one of those tools is called Pandas.

181
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:29.300
Stanley Omeike: So we're gonna go back now to our environment. I use Pandas to see how we can take data that is, not in we till it down to just those features, okay, or variables that contribute to an outcome.

182
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.870
Stanley Omeike: I want to get out so far

183
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:50.699
Stanley Omeike: just from now for the purpose of our uh jaguars in this class, because now you guys are in advance class. So you need to lend some jag on to show your colleagues that you are right. Right. So let's see if if you, jack on the board. Let's pick up a few dragons for this trade.

184
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:19.010
Stanley Omeike: Okay, right. So you said that you that will target variable. So keep that in mind because we're trying to predict employee attrition. We're going to call it target variable now, depending on the literature you read all right. Some will call it the dependence variable

185
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.670
Stanley Omeike: also depended on who you ask.

186
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.520
Stanley Omeike: Some will also call it the outcome variable,

187
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.930
Stanley Omeike: outcome, variable,

188
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.640
Stanley Omeike: and also depending on who you are.

189
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:55.260
Stanley Omeike: So whenever you read any literature, and you come across this down the target variable,

190
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:12.699
Stanley Omeike: Okay, or that we're trying to uh diagnose or figure out uh what it's it to be, or What is influenced in this behavior? Are we together so far

191
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:36.929
Stanley Omeike: for the input variables, this for the one on the left hand side that are the partos we are analyzing to determine their relationship to have been predicted. Um variable, sometimes depending on the digital you read, they might be called okay, They independently

192
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.680
David Kwenev: okay. It might be called

193
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.500
John Oglewu: the

194
00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.939
Stanley Omeike: the input variable,

195
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.760
Stanley Omeike: All right.

196
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.029
Stanley Omeike: It might be

197
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.309
Odion Joel Okonofua: explanatory variables

198
00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.770
Stanley Omeike: features,

199
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.040
Stanley Omeike: all right. They can be calling features,

200
00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.970
Stanley Omeike: and also because

201
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.880
Stanley Omeike: alright,

202
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:37.189
Stanley Omeike: yeah, so they can be called independent variables.

203
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.790
Stanley Omeike: Huh! We

204
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.270
Stanley Omeike: No, no, no, we don't

205
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.410
Odion Joel Okonofua: also.

206
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.420
Stanley Omeike: Uh

207
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.460
Odion Joel Okonofua: we

208
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:59.350
Odion Joel Okonofua: we's

209
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:11.890
Stanley Omeike: Oh, no, no, no, I think I think you right ahead of the class. So wait, wait, wait! Are basically something that happens in the back end of the machine learning

210
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:31.570
Stanley Omeike: when it lends the relationship between this feature and the output variable. It will assign a week to the strength of that relationship. So There' be something like here. It will still be dispatched. Variable accounts for zero point, one, two okay of the change in of those out changes.

211
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:42.790
Stanley Omeike: And then it comes here. Checks exactly the relationship with this one, and It's okay. This one accounts for zero point, zero zero, which means it has no carry. So which I

212
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.080
Stanley Omeike: All right.

213
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.290
Stanley Omeike: Are you with me? So far,

214
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.830
Boniface Abutu: this Bro:

215
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:59.220
Stanley Omeike: Okay, which just represent the strength of the influence of the input variable on the target. Variable. Not. I. Use the jack on very comfortable. Nobody is. They worried right?

216
00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:10.810
Stanley Omeike: Yes. So all right. So now you guys have learned, and it's important to remember this, because we'll be running into it when we get into class uh or what? Uh, when we get into our

217
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.290
Stanley Omeike: um, i'll work.

218
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:20.650
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So this whole class on data around is about helping you. And then the skills to take data that is thirty,

219
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:31.870
Stanley Omeike: and then transform it into features that can be used to model the class variable to predict the class variable. There was something I wanted to point out here. Um,

220
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.440
Stanley Omeike: all right. It's called it noisy variable. So let's do that. These are features and see

221
00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.110
Stanley Omeike: if any

222
00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.559
Stanley Omeike: be noisy.

223
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.890
Stanley Omeike: Okay, Okay,

224
00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:21.540
Stanley Omeike: you guys a feature here that can influence employee attrition, but does not necessarily predict it,

225
00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:35.720
Stanley Omeike: which is a definition of noise. Noise is any feature that that tops. Okay. Let me write that, because you know, you guys have to be picking these words. Now, you are no more in a uh data science in that gotten So

226
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.409
Stanley Omeike: uh next. What did you say?

227
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.300
Stanley Omeike: I can see very confidently.

228
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.810
That's

229
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.400
Stanley Omeike: you guys agree,

230
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.170
Joshua Abiodun: and you don't

231
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.959
Stanley Omeike: So

232
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.619
Stanley Omeike: an employee disciplinary record

233
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.670
daveg: can influence employee attrition,

234
00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.210
but does not necessarily predict it.

235
00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.270
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, I do with that.

236
00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.639
Stanley Omeike: Let me tell you why. I think there are people

237
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:17.420
Stanley Omeike: who thrive on the edge. Okay, these are people who caught trouble, not because they like to. But you know, for some reason they have an opportunity for problems. Okay? Uh, if there is any trouble happening anywhere, they usually do in the eyes of that problem.

238
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:40.899
Stanley Omeike: Just a very long way from my Euroba friends in Nigeria. I think that's a language you usually call it for. Manila.

239
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.009
Boniface Abutu: Mhm

240
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:49.470
Stanley Omeike: Yeah,

241
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:22.880
Stanley Omeike: Okay, guys, Thanks. Let's just go. The employee is committed to the organization. He has the intention of going anywhere but that that's attitudes of into the organization. He has the intention of going anywhere but that that's attitude towards the organization and building him to cost and pay stroll.

242
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.449
Stanley Omeike: Are we together?

243
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:41.389
Stanley Omeike: So what that reason I might not want to add. You know, disciplinary records in employee if I was trying to predict when an employee is going to be promoted next they may be.

244
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.779
Rex Onwudinjo: Yes, sir.

245
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:50.380
Stanley Omeike: Okay. I hope you guys, between a noisy feature and a dead feature, a feature that contributes nothing.

246
00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:55.309
Rebecca Oyetunji: So can you hear. Your voice is low compared to the voice of the

247
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.549
what?

248
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.509
Stanley Omeike: Well, my voice is low.

249
00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.230
Rebecca Oyetunji: Yes, I do normally do one experience in this.

250
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:33.530
Stanley Omeike: It's okay, guys, Let me have the information. So, Rebecca, Why, don't you uh you that increase the volume, and let me see if I can change. Let me see what Mike, my system is. You

251
00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.730
Rex Onwudinjo: my depend on the environment.

252
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.779
Stanley Omeike: I just changed my mind. Is that better, Rebecca?

253
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:53.349
Stanley Omeike: All right. So you see, Rebecca, I wasn't wrong after all.

254
00:38:53.860 --> 00:39:02.519
Stanley Omeike: So let's Let's move on. Thanks for bringing that up. Okay, Now, before I move on, let me take a few hands that i'll uh tope, or your hand is up

255
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.430
Stanley Omeike: all right. No problem.

256
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:34.540
Emmanuel Adeitan: But that was when we actually all the features. Okay, all right,

257
00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.260
Stanley Omeike: Hey, John, if you're speaking, I not hearing what you're saying.

258
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:46.970
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, I can hear you now.

259
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:58.580
John Oglewu: Okay, Then I was going to say that. Uh, we can also use a response variable for our outcomes, and I with my hand.

260
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:18.350
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So we we don't use. We don't use response variable. Then, uh, we don't use a response. Because here you're building a model. Uh, if you've done any research at graduate level, you might recognize. And I'm: speaking to everyone, not just on now. You might recognize the concept of structural equation models.

261
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.200
Stanley Omeike: Predict those and ask our variables. Okay,

262
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.529
Stanley Omeike: Sorry. Excuse me.

263
00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.139
Alright,

264
00:40:45.040 --> 00:41:04.089
Stanley Omeike: So we're gonna look at data opposition data transmission and feature selection. And you can see that I've spent over thirty minutes discussing this part, because this is the call of your data. Ugly Academy, if you lend nothing. In fact, if you don't lend any of these with, and i'm not giving you permission to run away on Dutch classes.

265
00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:11.430
Stanley Omeike: If you, if you don't lend any of these three, any of all all these items you have here,

266
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:17.140
Stanley Omeike: just make sure that you must have this three, and it will be well with you.

267
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:46.620
Stanley Omeike: So we're going to learn how to in data as start working on that we're going to learn how to bring in videos types of data, excel, file, Csv. File the Json file the pickle file uh um dot k file the text file all kinds of darkness. We're also going to learn how to bring in Sql data.

268
00:41:46.740 --> 00:42:10.969
Stanley Omeike: Okay, into our Jupiter, we can work So for that We're going to be then in introduction to Sql: So you will also be able to write simple select statements. Union statements, you know unconditional statements to bring in data from Sql: you'll learn how to connect to an Sql database, and I can't pull data onto your. So okay uh we have a lot of fun uh we have lined up for you guys as we go.

269
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:17.810
Stanley Omeike: Uh. Well, it's fun depending on who you ask It's fun for me what I know it might be. It will work for you guys to

270
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:33.269
Stanley Omeike: all right now, after we've learned all of this, then we are ready to apply it in an introductory session to using python spark and library to process data.

271
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:48.089
Stanley Omeike: Okay, So you guys are going to learn how to process it. They're going to train you to take data. That is date thirty, and work on it. Massage it, ruggle it, run clean it till it becomes data that is highly ready for model development. Right?

272
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:57.759
Stanley Omeike: And your capstone project will be exactly that. Your capstone project You will give in a very densey data, and you be asked to clean it in preparation for

273
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:29.390
Stanley Omeike: I mean data or Angla. If you have any data you need to clean or pre-process before modeling should it, that me and i'll take care of it. Okay, because that's an important skill in the data science, data, analytics and machine learning field. So this is uh a quick introduction to everything. We're going to be covering today.

274
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:34.310
Stanley Omeike: Sorry. Not today in this in this program over the next two months.

275
00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:44.709
Stanley Omeike: Alright, uh, Rebecca, your hand is up,

276
00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:55.220
Rebecca Oyetunji: and after this it's possible for once to then moving into.

277
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.220
Stanley Omeike: Okay, Rebecca, I didn't quite hear you. There was some kind of noise coming in between.

278
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:20.510
Stanley Omeike: Okay, Which truck are you in, Rebecca, Are you in Ml: data, science or data analytics?

279
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:29.989
Rebecca Oyetunji: Okay, I was

280
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:42.210
Stanley Omeike: okay. So uh. The reason why you might not get a feedback immediately is because, regardless of which truck you are in data, science, machine learning, or that you're all going through the Um,

281
00:44:42.220 --> 00:45:01.710
Stanley Omeike: all going through data Visualization Academy together after detail, Visualization Academy together after detail visualization. I can everybody paths with to get a real struck, you understand? So the question you're asking about. So which track you should go to ask that question again was the end of the visualization Academy. Okay,

282
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:06.849
Rebecca Oyetunji: alright, uh, at Abc.

283
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.849
Stanley Omeike: Do you have a question?

284
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:23.700
Adebisi Enochoghene: Yes, I have a question. I I want to know how um committed. We are to this six week uh six week schedule that you have at night for us, because

285
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:42.669
Adebisi Enochoghene: I I I didn't feel good. That's the initial that's by tone and training it it took for him, and it almost will never mean so before. So people begin to cook up reasons why you should extend the reasons why I I feel that I should. There. Is that any?

286
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:50.420
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, Okay. So So that's an important question, and it is not six weeks. It's more than six weeks. Okay, He's probably like ten weeks from now.

287
00:45:50.470 --> 00:46:07.670
Stanley Omeike: Okay, it's. It's more than six weeks, because, like I said, we'll wrap this up by first week of um January, and then you do your capstone project and then move on. So it's It's feasible, but it lot depends on their simulation rate of uh our students. And

288
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:14.760
Stanley Omeike: let me just highlight something here, because I've been. I've heard this. I've had this before from a number of students.

289
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:29.300
Stanley Omeike: You guys are in the

290
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:39.279
Stanley Omeike: okay. If for any reason you feel you're in a hurry and you want to just go at cloud speed and finish your program. You can actually apply to the world campus, fast track

291
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:59.390
Stanley Omeike: uh data science, Ml: and data analytics program that one finishes in about, you know, three months in three months you are done. What happens is there's a lecturer who talks to you for about an hour. Take questions for thirty minutes, that's all. And then you're loaded with materials and work to do, and it goes at clock speed.

292
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:12.970
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, it's not time to hand. Hold anybody who is struggling at that point. You need to be to talk with your peers, or do a lot of studies, or meet your professor or instructor if they are available. But that's a fast track

293
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:24.819
Stanley Omeike: in the Gothic program. Our first understanding is that nobody here has ever heard anything about python or data science. Therefore, if we prioritize or we must finish in six weeks,

294
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:33.429
Stanley Omeike: it helps nobody. If we finish in six weeks unless I have the class on the I. I don't know if you guys can relate to that.

295
00:47:55.610 --> 00:48:10.030
Adebisi Enochoghene: Okay, It's just the reason I had. I said, six weeks because of the schedule you sent to our emails. You know you. We are supposed to have a a zoom session every two weeks. So that's what I actually meant by

296
00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:29.969
Adebisi Enochoghene: six weeks. Not that I I meant six weeks in reality, which which that's supposed to be like twelve weeks. I'm only asking that are we going to follow that so, because we we can't just keep going random. And the other one you mentioned. I would like to know about it, because I don't have a lot of time

297
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:34.269
Adebisi Enochoghene: on hand to just keep dancing around.

298
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:40.600
Stella Okenu: Okay, uh, uh, I did. You see? I will just take a J. To the exception to some of the words you use.

299
00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:59.549
Stanley Omeike: Nobody here is dancing around uh Number Two people who come here are here to learn. I understand that your priorities are probably a bit different. I'm pressed for time than if you are that person. But, uh, we don't dance around here. We try to make sure we carry everybody forward.

300
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.789
Stanley Omeike: Um if you are interested in the fast track. Um

301
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:29.299
Stanley Omeike: um alternative to the program, which is not a gutsy program, it's actually all you need to be is right on campus, and they would, you know, direct you there? Ninety paid for program. It's not got to be console, understand? At that point. If you pay for the training and you get it Training? Um, you know, tied to whatever timelines we have. But here, honestly, we are more into mentoring students to learn

302
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:44.950
Stanley Omeike: than just trying to make a certain timeline on my own. Okay. So if this does not fit your learning style, or your any requirements, I can understand that. Uh, but don't think that people here uh dancing around. Okay,

303
00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:54.569
Stanley Omeike: All right. Uh, i'm glad you've moderated that.

304
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.670
Stanley Omeike: All right. Uh Samson. Uh, you have a question. Thanks.

305
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:31.270
Samson Ikuenayo: Alright, So I i'm getting new response from Samsung. Now, what I need you guys to do. Okay, Go on something. Yes, I Just what is a echo in the when your voice, which makes it a hard to here.

306
00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.419
Stanley Omeike: Uh! Is this the echoing, now?

307
00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:05.880
CJay - Chijioke Nnabueze: Is there any better?

308
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:09.529
Stanley Omeike: I'm not here in any echo.

309
00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:39.330
Stanley Omeike: I'm pleased to you to stay muted. Uh, we're gonna get started today uh by giving you a gentle introduction to how to uh bring in Jupiter notebook Uh: bring in plan does on your and then get started. So the start of your environment,

310
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:44.129
Stanley Omeike: my anak that environment

311
00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.059
Stanley Omeike: i'll be

312
00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:59.700
Stanley Omeike: so uh

313
00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:03.029
Stanley Omeike: Um, mine is coming up, I think.

314
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.979
Stanley Omeike: Yes,

315
00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:36.269
Enoch Olorundare: yes, I I also want to. Sorry for the to this. Um,

316
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.950
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So uh i'm in documents i'm trying to find my world, because that's my workspace.

317
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.860
Stanley Omeike: Um, So it's in the books.

318
00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.690
Stanley Omeike: And then starting in a group

319
00:52:50.930 --> 00:53:10.230
Stanley Omeike: uh python kind of okay. So today's what Thursday you should get these recordings. Um, let us by tomorrow. Please note that you are getting it on the World Academy Portal, because I hear that you trying to go to Google, That and uh you, we can get it on your world. I can. Then you both are okay.

320
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:20.840
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So the platform is a bit different from what we used to know. How are we going to?

321
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:32.579
Stanley Omeike: Okay? I will spend some time shooting how to access the platform we are today, But for now let's see uh focus on the class. Um uh proceedings. Okay,

322
00:53:32.860 --> 00:54:02.320
Stanley Omeike: Thank you very much. Now, the first we want to do is we want to import pandas. All right, like I said. Pandas is the data around link to We use it for loading data on to Jupiter a book. We use it for access and time series data and matrix shift data to do. We're going to work with both the matrix and times. We use data. We're not going to do any serious

323
00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:06.510
Stanley Omeike: right. So you write your in both.

324
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:09.719
Stanley Omeike: That's the first thing you want to write

325
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:22.540
Stanley Omeike: when you run it.

326
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:31.110
Stanley Omeike: Okay, you're on the impose it meant. And tell me if you get an error or not, you don't get an arrow after you're on that. So it means uh, and that's is looted.

327
00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.470
Stanley Omeike: Um,

328
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:48.819
Stanley Omeike: you're seeing excel screen.

329
00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:00.410
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So when I close up on my

330
00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.689
Stanley Omeike: let's go to screen one.

331
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:10.339
Joshua Abiodun: Yeah,

332
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.890
Imaikop Bassey: I've changed. So I launched

333
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:25.139
Stanley Omeike: and I've written an import statement for Pandas in my first, so I want you to go ahead and write that. Let's see. It works for you

334
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.229
with us.

335
00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:49.689
Rex Onwudinjo: I was on that, sir.

336
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:50.830
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

337
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:05.430
right.

338
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:18.929
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So if you've done that, that means it won't for you. So now we can use fund us uh in any work we're trying to do.

339
00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:32.100
Stanley Omeike: Um. I wanted to see if I can pick if I I give you guys both uh, if you not to avoid that we in our time, I'm going to import on our library. That allows us to access small data sets easily, so i'm going to import

340
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.499
Stanley Omeike: see bonnies on our library,

341
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:45.039
Stanley Omeike: for example, I'll run it.

342
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:22.080
Stanley Omeike: We'll do it later. But for now I just want to explain something.

343
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.850
Stanley Omeike: All right. So

344
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:28.909
Stanley Omeike: have you guys been able to import all went well.

345
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:48.290
Stanley Omeike: C. Bond. I just give it an acronym, so that when I want to work with it, it's easy for with reference, I don't you type. You go what see born each time I want to refer to it. So I just present it with a new name, if you like,

346
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:56.790
Stanley Omeike: and and I called it so any time I want to reference it. I just call S. And I I do. You guys understand that

347
00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:11.280
Stanley Omeike: now se born is a library for visualization. So you, you're going to work in those with Seaborn, and some of the libraries like is in your next executive. But for today. We are interested in it because it also who some small data sets we can work with

348
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.180
Stanley Omeike: that gets.

349
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:25.350
Stanley Omeike: I know that Smd are refers to. Uh, all right. Okay, that's a set. I think names.

350
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:27.930
If I run that

351
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:32.220
Stanley Omeike: it will be all the data.

352
00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.899
Stanley Omeike: All right. Now, the using Why, i'm working you. Sometimes you want to practice.

353
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:52.150
Stanley Omeike: So that's what we're going to do today.

354
00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:03.330
Yeah,

355
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:17.080
Raji Azeez: Lang:

356
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:40.780
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So what I've done is I've called this functional. I see one to tell me what kind of data that you want. Have I just assumed all these data? All right. These are all data uh data tables in seibo for today. We're going to work with the I Re. States.

357
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:49.229
Stanley Omeike: Alright, So i'm going to show you how to get the I these data from, and then use that to do your um to do the work we're trying to do today.

358
00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.779
Stanley Omeike: So for that we're going to see

359
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.500
Stanley Omeike: s and

360
00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.620
Stanley Omeike: data sets. I'm sorry.

361
01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:11.189
Stanley Omeike: Something is what we might type in today.

362
01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:19.029
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So this is going to help us load our Ir data sets.

363
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:28.099
Stanley Omeike: If I run this.

364
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.420
Stanley Omeike: Thank you,

365
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.689
Stanley Omeike: it gives me

366
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.379
Joshua Abiodun: Jesus.

367
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.040
MUIZZ ADIO: What did you say?

368
01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:51.569
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So it gives us a small data that contains a hundred and fifty records. Okay, not not very large, but good enough for us to practice whatever I want to practice.

369
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.890
Stanley Omeike: All right. So let me see, lose the.

370
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:14.630
Stanley Omeike: Now, this type of data in is referred to as the matrix data. It's matrix because it consists of

371
01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.209
MUIZZ ADIO: and rules.

372
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:30.250
Stanley Omeike: I want to. If you are using excel, or maybe S to do colleagues, my quality to. But in in data, science, the quality matrix, alright, or it detail free

373
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:49.460
Stanley Omeike: each of these headers you have here, and I I hope you guys are paying wrapped attention. As I try to explain these concepts, each of these headers you have which represent Callums. We refer to them as

374
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.559
Stanley Omeike: features. All right, so.

375
01:01:53.830 --> 01:02:00.830
Stanley Omeike: And maybe I need to explain what this details about. So this data is about printing what type of flower,

376
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.370
Stanley Omeike: what you see

377
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:22.219
Stanley Omeike: just based on the size of the uh and the of the the the the the the. On the basis of this dimensions of the petals and the of the flower, we can predict what type of flower it is

378
01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:31.940
Stanley Omeike: which is a class variable. How much is the regular variable

379
01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:39.250
Stanley Omeike: David

380
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:56.149
David Kwenev: Lang?

381
01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:21.379
Stanley Omeike: Well, the order, one, two, four, four, are the Uh independent features. It's not very correct. So the species call you in case uh, and all these colleagues put together are the input variables, the practical variables. Okay, the independent variables, or whatever name you want.

382
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.349
Stanley Omeike: All right. So that's what we have here. Now,

383
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:32.840
Stanley Omeike: we didn't do the time on data,

384
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:39.779
Stanley Omeike: Ludin.

385
01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.080
Mhm

386
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.819
Stanley Omeike: So that's going to be S. And the blue

387
01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:55.879
Stanley Omeike: in bracket. I put the name of the data. I want to lose.

388
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:02.919
Boniface Abutu: No,

389
01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:10.150
Stanley Omeike: yes. So if I run this. Now.

390
01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.970
Okay,

391
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:16.990
Boniface Abutu: it works movement.

392
01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:21.660
Stanley Omeike: I don't want it to work for me to. I just trying to figure out why it's. Let me see born how

393
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:26.660
Stanley Omeike: uh data, also in good details. That is my aeroc.

394
01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:29.179
Okay,

395
01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:32.139
Raji Azeez: that makes sense.

396
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.680
Raji Azeez: No?

397
01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:45.099
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So you can see that this data has loaded,

398
01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.250
Stanley Omeike: all right.

399
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:17.339
Stanley Omeike: Yes, I don't want to read in your group Chat. You have somebody. You see. How can I get data? How can I get data? Because now you know how to get data

400
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:25.330
Gavin Abiamuwe: all right, and you have access to more than ten different. You guys.

401
01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:43.589
Stanley Omeike: Okay? So you have access to more than twenty different data sets here that you can use to do uh most of your practices. So i'm just going to take you both on some questions before we start using one particular

402
01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.099
Rex Onwudinjo: this um i'm having issue.

403
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:54.169
Rex Onwudinjo: I'm getting my own seat on here.

404
01:05:54.250 --> 01:06:14.149
Rex Onwudinjo: It's because you made mention of that. You know how to that download. It is. Is there any way I can download it, because mine is telling me when I run this importantly se board as as then. When I run this. It was telling me that these building the phones catch it may take some moment something on nature, so it didn't show those

405
01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.410
Busola Adedoyin: names in.

406
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:17.000
Got it,

407
01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.220
Stanley Omeike: did you, did you?

408
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:22.350
Rex Onwudinjo: Yes.

409
01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:24.359
Stanley Omeike: Did you get an error when you run it?

410
01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:25.990
Yeah.

411
01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:29.150
Dexter Emmanuel: So I guess it's not connected to the Internet?

412
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:45.000
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, I think, connect to you. You need to be connected to the Internet. You, at least for the first time when you're trying to import it. Actually, you're not supposed you don't need to be connected to the Internet. Um, if you, if you are using an acunda, if you already have pre installed with your anaconda,

413
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.870
Stanley Omeike: all right,

414
01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:57.649
Stanley Omeike: lang

415
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:00.450
it's.

416
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:15.659
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, just it's still with me. You will get the solution. Okay. So we go ahead and run this next slide. So we go ahead and run this next slide.

417
01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:28.960
Stanley Omeike: All right. Now for those of you. We're going to be working today with um, which did us actually use thef. Now let's use.

418
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:46.820
Stanley Omeike: I think we should work with. We should work with the demons data set. So i'm going to see this demo data set to disk and they shape it, you guys right here so that those of you who don't have it can at least do it on use.

419
01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:53.760
Stanley Omeike: Now, this is an important skill for all of you how to receive a data frame

420
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.590
Stanley Omeike: Zoom Csv:

421
01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:00.020
on your computer.

422
01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:13.990
Stanley Omeike: So now we have this different frame called uh developments in order to save it as a data frame or my computer. I first need to assign the that we variable.

423
01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:25.129
Stanley Omeike: So i'm going to copy that and then create a new variable. I'll call that variable data from Df: Most times when you read this data science text, you can see them referring to data sets out there.

424
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.229
MUIZZ ADIO: That's what you

425
01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.229
Stanley Omeike: df means data free.

426
01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:42.539
Stanley Omeike: So df these people and you can't give it any name you want. In fact, I can call this

427
01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:53.089
Stanley Omeike: all right. It is to work just so that you guys can see if I run it. Now that data has been assigned to, so I can now use it for my work. I can see prints.

428
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.479
Stanley Omeike: Got it

429
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:57.140
Stanley Omeike: all right. If I run that

430
01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.580
Stanley Omeike: I get my data.

431
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:00.999
Stanley Omeike: Are you guys with me so far?

432
01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:06.649
Gavin Abiamuwe: Yes, somebody lost me somehow.

433
01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:20.799
Gavin Abiamuwe: Okay, Gavin, because I use your name. No, no, no, no, no, because you use my name. I I went, I I I lost my so I didn't even know I didn't get to see everything. Okay. But when you, when we try to know that data,

434
01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:34.120
Stanley Omeike: no, just from the beginning, from where you say, import Uh, my. So in the beginning we imported pandas, and we also import this call and give it an acronym. S. And

435
01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.899
Stanley Omeike: uh, important.

436
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.010
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So

437
01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:27.679
Stanley Omeike: just be able to have access to some in It's library. Okay. So now that we've imported it, I've run it pretty here just to show you all the data sets in the library. You can see there are many yeah, probably more than twenty. I've never accounted before, but it's probably up to twenty right now that we have this

438
01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:39.879
Stanley Omeike: data access to this data because of your for that, C One which okay, let's display one of the dates are the That's this data here, this, this, this this data, and I give you code to.

439
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:18.179
Stanley Omeike: So now that we have it, had it, some people said it could not run se ball right? Some people didn't have access to se board, I said. Okay, I can download this data. Save it type of file. I'll share it with you guys here immediately. So that's what i'm trying to do next.

440
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:31.240
Stanley Omeike: And I said it doesn't matter what name you keep it available.

441
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:52.609
Stanley Omeike: He can be governed. He can be Stanley. He can be God's time. He can be Jude. You can be you, Michael, whatever it is. Okay. So what we went ahead with Govern right? Because we loved that in so much. So we use Gavin as the variable name to load the data. So I run this cell now.

442
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.469
Stanley Omeike: So what I see in French company.

443
01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.550
MUIZZ ADIO: We're going to use the

444
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:39.270
Stanley Omeike: all right. That's what we're going to use.

445
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:46.670
Stanley Omeike: Now, this is very good to see all using pandas for the first time. Alright, we're going to be using Pandas for the first time to see.

446
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.829
Stanley Omeike: So i'm going to see.

447
01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.010
Yeah,

448
01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.870
Stanley Omeike: uh that'll be tf

449
01:12:58.570 --> 01:12:59.679
Stanley Omeike: that's

450
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:16.580
MUIZZ ADIO: cool on.

451
01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.330
Stanley Omeike: Um. I think he's all four of us. Um

452
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.190
Stanley Omeike: uh walks, please.

453
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:26.130
Okay,

454
01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.160
Stanley Omeike: that you want to identify us.

455
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.329
Stanley Omeike: These documents is going to be saved

456
01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.419
Stanley Omeike: in whatever

457
01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.170
Stanley Omeike: are we all together so far?

458
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:18.560
Stanley Omeike: Yes, okay. But I want it to be somewhere that I can go ahead and check for. So i'm going to put that. So that's the path he's going to see me in my drive, c. In the fuller code workspace in, and they need that food. I just call it that one. Let me go, and for that for you guys.

459
01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.450
Stanley Omeike: Um.

460
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.600
Stanley Omeike: So if I bring this to view here,

461
01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:42.470
Stanley Omeike: I do very tiny when it comes. But hopefully you'll be able to see. I'll be full of call. Works this my my drive, c.

462
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.800
Right now

463
01:14:55.730 --> 01:14:57.379
Stanley Omeike: and they around this.

464
01:14:58.370 --> 01:15:01.850
Stanley Omeike: Okay, I've run it now. So let me bring back my.

465
01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:07.439
Stanley Omeike: They bring about the um.

466
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:28.200
Stanley Omeike: I have an error. Let me see. Data frame object has No, and that's okay. So let's move on. That's because I've already

467
01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.679
Stanley Omeike: Rhonda:

468
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:35.770
Stanley Omeike: No, I can see the demons there.

469
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:50.880
Stanley Omeike: Uh: it's coming. I hope.

470
01:15:51.290 --> 01:16:03.650
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, that's it. So I have Kara's course. Color, clarity depths uh table price all the way to my the all the features we have in the data,

471
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:12.810
Stanley Omeike: but one That's My, I added, the index for you this zero one, two, three you're seeing here is this: Let's go back here and look at it.

472
01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:15.070
Well,

473
01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:25.550
Stanley Omeike: that's what

474
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.040
let's see

475
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.820
Stanley Omeike: they give me x.

476
01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:53.919
Stanley Omeike: So this x is the range starting from zero to fifty, three thousand nine hundred and forty,

477
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:14.439
Stanley Omeike: so that is it fifty-three thousand nine hundred and forty. One Um! It's forty. You just already had a

478
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:23.669
Stanley Omeike: so I've saved it. But I don't want this index calling any data, but I don't want it. I'm going to receive it at the index.

479
01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.420
Stanley Omeike: It was the fall

480
01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.570
Stanley Omeike: uh one.

481
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:40.409
Stanley Omeike: I've comment here for some of you

482
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:41.910
Stanley Omeike: uh the

483
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:43.690
Stanley Omeike: index.

484
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:45.580
Stanley Omeike: It was the false,

485
01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:49.779
all right.

486
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:07.839
Stanley Omeike: So that was index.

487
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:16.250
Stanley Omeike: So i'm going to run this now. Uh, I think I should down this in a difference. So for those of you who might want it.

488
01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:17.929
Stanley Omeike: So that's

489
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:32.110
Stanley Omeike: what I do is just grab yourself

490
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:33.689
No problem.

491
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:35.629
Stanley Omeike: I'm. Probably

492
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:39.990
you, too,

493
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:42.959
Stanley Omeike: and I will remove all of this

494
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:54.220
Stanley Omeike: alright, I just, you know this is this

495
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:57.439
Stanley Omeike: also saves

496
01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.500
Stanley Omeike: the index.

497
01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.920
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So this will be the second record.

498
01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:16.149
Stanley Omeike: Oh, the index,

499
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:20.609
Stanley Omeike: all right.

500
01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:22.690
Stanley Omeike: So if I run this now.

501
01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:24.099
MUIZZ ADIO: Well,

502
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:46.710
Stanley Omeike: so this is that month's one. You can see the index. I only have Karat, as you guys call you,

503
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:55.940
Stanley Omeike: got Call up clarity, you know, and all the rest. If I bring up the original one, which is just that you will see the difference

504
01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.289
Stanley Omeike: for that once we have.

505
01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:13.519
Stanley Omeike: You can see that we had the in this call. It was added. There's an index, call it. We don't want this, because

516
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:53.480
Stanley Omeike: so please. Uh check the chat window. Now you will see the file. Two point five megabytes. Please download it, and that's for those who are having issues with. But for the rest of you it's fine. So in this short spell you guys have learned how to save the data frame to disk,

517
01:21:53.550 --> 01:22:13.440
Stanley Omeike: even though it's not part of the lesson for today. What! This you plans to show you how to save um. You've got to see it as excel. So you can do that. Just change Csv to excel X Uh. E. X. Cl: Okay, I need to save it for so make sure to change the extension to the Xls

518
01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:14.859
when you this evening.

519
01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:21.579
Stanley Omeike: So let's come back to now that we have our, which is the um,

520
01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:26.640
Stanley Omeike: which is the uh demons data. But let's not proceed with

521
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:29.830
Stanley Omeike: you guys. Um! At this point

522
01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:33.969
Stanley Omeike: uh it might get it to be technical. So please stick with me. Okay.

523
01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:44.889
Stanley Omeike: So step one is, how do we load that data that I just created? I'm: going to show you how to load data.

524
01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.400
Stanley Omeike: Oh,

525
01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.320

Boniface Abutu: Okay, Okay, Thank you for

539
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:52.089
Stanley Omeike: alright. Okay. And also uh James Tppa:

540
01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:55.630
Bola Jacob: please.

541
01:24:55.730 --> 01:25:15.370
James Ekpa: Hello, Bro: Yeah, So I was trying to save my uh, my files. Everything worked out. I was trying to seventy-five what it was I think I I got on. I was saying that uh my uh data firm is not too fine. I think i'm missing out something uh you more than missing our first of all you need to have assigned

542
01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:24.049
Stanley Omeike: the uh That's bracket down on. We did a free of the year. Did you draw on this? Oh, okay, okay, Oh, No, no, thank you very much.

543
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:27.240
Stanley Omeike: If you have not assigned it, you can save it.

544
01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:08.349
Stanley Omeike: Um! It was soon finished again.

545
01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:30.109
Stanley Omeike: All right. So now let's look at how to load uh data sets

546
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:36.870
Stanley Omeike: from file onto the Jupiter

547
01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:43.910
Stanley Omeike: Alright, to be able to do that. We use

548
01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.670
Stanley Omeike: the pan does

549
01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.080
Stanley Omeike: Csv:

550
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.769
Stanley Omeike: the Csv files

551
01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.519
Stanley Omeike: for Csv files.

552
01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:01.700
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So

553
01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:07.209
Stanley Omeike: so we use that for Csv files

554
01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.900
Stanley Omeike: we use

555
01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:12.769
Stanley Omeike: read on this call,

556
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:14.210
Stanley Omeike: Excel

557
01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.379
Stanley Omeike: for excel

558
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.280
Stanley Omeike: excel files.

559
01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:28.389
Stanley Omeike: Okay, we use

560
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:33.290
Stanley Omeike: read on this call Jason.

561
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:34.700
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

562
01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:37.019
Stanley Omeike: for the Jason files.

563
01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:49.219
Stanley Omeike: So we're going to learn how to do that,

564
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:51.800
Stanley Omeike: to be able to load any data

565
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.950
Stanley Omeike: from your uh

566
01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:58.610
Busola Adedoyin: on file the step one is imports

567
01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.160
Stanley Omeike: on us

568
01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:16.589
Stanley Omeike: right now. We are using Pd. As an acronym for. Because let's visit when you, when you start working as we did a scientist. So you did our engineer. You can be typing lines and lines of um uh statements of code.

569
01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:27.909
Stanley Omeike: Anything that seems you key stroke is a very useful uh thing. So Pd. Is going to be the alias we're going to use. Refer to partners whenever I want to call any of these functions.

570
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:33.840
Stanley Omeike: So once you've done that, next thing you want to declare is the file name you want to import

571
01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:41.200
Stanley Omeike: my name you want to.

572
01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:44.919
Stanley Omeike: Mine is that once one dot Csv:

573
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.909
Stanley Omeike: right. Next thing you want is the path five parts.

574
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:52.860
Stanley Omeike: That's where the fight is to,

575
01:28:53.320 --> 01:29:05.160
Stanley Omeike: because to you have to go figure away it is, but I I can get it from how I save the file. Right. I see the file in C workspace. So this is my path, so i'll copy this.

576
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:07.670
Stanley Omeike: How good it here!

577
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:18.770
Stanley Omeike: So that's my half. That's where That's why it's already been located in my computer, and your only might be a different place, but always make sure you end with the for slash.

578
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:20.099
Stanley Omeike: Alright,

579
01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.769
Stanley Omeike: So now

580
01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.830
Stanley Omeike: to import the file.

581
01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.409
Stanley Omeike: I'll see food. But now this one going this step.

582
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:44.860
Stanley Omeike: It goes to five paths

583
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:49.080
Stanley Omeike: lost.

584
01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.509
Stanley Omeike: Alright, See if I see it

585
01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:56.290
Stanley Omeike: cool.

586
01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.250
Wow!

587
01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:04.559
Stanley Omeike: And I around this. This is where my five is located. You recognize that this

588
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:06.870
Stanley Omeike: string

589
01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:11.099
Stanley Omeike: is actually the same thing as this.

590
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.309
Stanley Omeike: Are you guys in agreement?

591
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:18.199
Bola Jacob: Yes, hello, guys.

592
01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:30.479
Stanley Omeike: Yes. But what I've done is try to help you see the the components, There is the name of the file, and there is directly to be full that where it is located

593
01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.849
Stanley Omeike: the down on this file

594
01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:41.750
Stanley Omeike: that we,

595
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:43.250
Stanley Omeike: i'll give you the

596
01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:04.990
Stanley Omeike: in that bracket. I'm going to put the full pop to where the file is,

597
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:08.680
Stanley Omeike: so for that i'll be using my full path,

598
01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:11.370
Stanley Omeike: all right,

599
01:31:13.650 --> 01:31:15.169
Stanley Omeike: if I run that

600
01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:18.710
Stanley Omeike: no error which means that that data has come in.

601
01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:21.880
Stanley Omeike: So now I can see it.

602
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:09.279
Jude: Yeah, I tried loading mine. Um, they have to say and put an arrow. It says, name the it's not defined

603
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:10.940
Stanley Omeike: there.

604
01:32:13.670 --> 01:32:17.760
Jude: Yeah, that when I want to load like when I want to save it. So Csv:

605
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:34.480
Stanley Omeike: Oh, oh, oh, you have to have the very good D of food in the file first before you try to save it.

606
01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:41.450
Jude: Okay? So

607
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.510
Daniel Ameh: we asked it.

608
01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.800

609
01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:55.340
Daniel Ameh: Yeah, thank you very much. Bye bye,

610

611
01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:16.819
Gavin Abiamuwe: If you see what it's, because I I know what the problem is. My is no working. No, no, no! What is it saying to you now? I'm not working. Doesn't. Provide any information. Okay, If I, after after writing a report, see Bone and I run this code.

612
01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:09.329
Gavin Abiamuwe: That was what I It does it on. That's called

613
01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:38.389
Stanley Omeike: because I think, Lorenz uh somebody. Somebody was trying to speak Laureate out. All right. I still there. Okay, Okay,

Raji Azeez: He's given me? Name, arrow,

618
01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:04.550
Raji Azeez: name, aero, the amount that most one is not defined,

619
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:21.960
Stanley Omeike: and so then parallel would be a function of How did What name did you call if I? You say, don't just use the good I sent you remove one from it. Maybe it does that amount right?

620
01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.759
Raji Azeez: So Csv:

621
01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:28.610
Jude: So check this penny because my spending might be different from your. So

622
01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:48.700
Stanley Omeike: okay, let me take you guys to be on the safe side. Go to that script where you saved it. You see that like where you deceiving, just copy it, control copy

623
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:50.599
Stanley Omeike: and bring it down here.

624
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:56.160
Stanley Omeike: Okay, and use the if you remove all of this. Now, I put it here.

625
01:35:56.250 --> 01:36:08.469
Raji Azeez: Uh, I make sure It's all in quotation marks. All right. I'm going to put all of them.

626
01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:30.099
Raji Azeez: That's why they do exactly what I just asked you to do. Go and let me know. That's why they do exactly what I just asked you to do. Go, and before then you let me know that you guys are thanks, for we saved it. They must be forward slashes

627
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:34.370
Stanley Omeike: and then go and use it to impose it back if you work. Okay,

628
01:36:35.230 --> 01:36:39.300
Stanley Omeike: but let me change because this is going to everybody.

629
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:47.769
Stanley Omeike: Alright, So I I need to. I need to get some speed guys. So you now have lunch. How to load data. All right. Let me just clean this up

630
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:55.759
Stanley Omeike: uh You've learned how to do data and like I was trying to explain to you. Each calling here represents a feature in our data.

631
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:19.649
Stanley Omeike: So I have sample zero

632
01:37:19.890 --> 01:37:21.480
Stanley Omeike: sample, one

633
01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:23.790
Stanley Omeike: sample two

634
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:26.900
Stanley Omeike: all the way to sample. And in my data,

635
01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:33.590
Stanley Omeike: right? So let me just make that note here for you guys. Uh, did the frames?

636
01:37:34.650 --> 01:37:36.430
Stanley Omeike: Hi matrices

637
01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.460
Raji Azeez: as well?

638
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.139
Raji Azeez: That

639
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:57.160
Um,

640
01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:58.809
Raji Azeez: it? Okay.

641
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.359
Stanley Omeike: Thanks.

642
01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:04.000
Stanley Omeike: Okay.

643
01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:09.290
Stanley Omeike: It calls

644
01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:11.450
Stanley Omeike: features

645
01:38:13.630 --> 01:38:14.740
and

646
01:38:15.150 --> 01:38:16.809
Stanley Omeike: data rules,

647
01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:20.099
Stanley Omeike: calls

648
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:22.870
sound tools.

649
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:35.230
Stanley Omeike: Alright, So you guys should keep that in mind as the structure of I did after now, to find out the shape of your data free, for example, how many callumes? How many rules do I have in the days that you use if function in Pandas

650
01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:38.019
Stanley Omeike: to get the shape

651
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:41.090
Stanley Omeike: of the data sets

652
01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:43.279
Stanley Omeike: number

653
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:45.710
Stanley Omeike: all features

654
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:48.500
Stanley Omeike: uh samples.

655
01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:52.719
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So for that we're going to use the functional code

656
01:39:01.570 --> 01:39:02.760
that she

657
01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:15.190
Stanley Omeike: alright So you just call data sheep. He tells you very clearly how many samples and how many features are in your data right now. Are you guys seeing my screen

658
01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.210
Stanley Omeike: of the features?

659
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:19.840
Francisca: Yes, pro

660
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:44.559
Stanley Omeike: it just said, calling

661
01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:47.309
Stanley Omeike: to a list.

662
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:50.030
Imaikop Bassey: So this will be

663
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:52.920
Stanley Omeike: uh calls i'll call It calls

664
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:55.139
Stanley Omeike: it close to

665
01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:58.010
Stanley Omeike: list in brackets.

666
01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:11.669
Stanley Omeike: Alright, So now, if I call Prince, you will see that it's going to be different calls If I run this Now I see the presentation is now different from this other one.

667
01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.070
Godwin Ubogun: Yes, please,

668
01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:28.700
Stanley Omeike: and so I can. It's read to it. This is in index position, Zero. This is in one. This is in two two. This is the three all the way to add, All right, so I can just quickly write it for you for

669
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:33.120
cool.

670
01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.130
Stanley Omeike: All right. If I do that,

671
01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:38.879
Stanley Omeike: I get that. So this you that I can do through it right?

672
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:40.530
Yes, Pro,

673
01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:43.780
Stanley Omeike: I can see

674
01:41:49.190 --> 01:42:04.579
Stanley Omeike: that's good. I'm happy for you. Alright, So basically now, i'm, i'm going to really top and bring all of you back again, just so that we're on the same page uh to this class is very good concerns uh, so that you can follow.

675
01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.030
Stanley Omeike: When we started class today we talked about.

676
01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:10.319
Stanley Omeike: We're also going to have uh classes on Sto. You're going to learn how to create Sql: data sets unexstruct things, using the next statements. We have losses, you know. And

677
01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:24.059
Stanley Omeike: and then, once we learn all of these, we're going to use that to. Now carry out data clean. We'll go end to end same data. That is very dirty. I'll walk through the process to clean the data.

678
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:40.640
Stanley Omeike: Okay, you will be forgiven if you don't know all five times. All you know is that Csv:

679
01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:52.960
Stanley Omeike: nobody will, you know. Uh? Query your knowledge. If you don't know Sql: you still survive as a data scientist or an engineer. I don't use sql in all my

680
01:43:52.970 --> 01:44:01.639
Stanley Omeike: who work as a data sciences. I don't use sql, but we're teaching you because there is a lot of them versus on being able to create those data sets.

681
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:21.650
Stanley Omeike: Okay, So this introduction to five spark library for data processing is just the of everything You've learned from one to three.

682
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:23.950
Stanley Omeike: Okay.

683
01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:50.180
Stanley Omeike: So that's what we said. We're going to cover. And we started. Illustrating things about data by you know, taking an example of you working in a company, and the Md. Or your manager is to want to build a model that will predict which employees or set of employees are likely to resign from our company in the next couple of years. So do the model that this is the probability, index, or any given employee uh,

684
01:44:50.190 --> 01:44:52.900
Stanley Omeike: you know, dropping off the deployment of our business.

685
01:44:53.600 --> 01:45:02.400
Stanley Omeike: Uh, you and I follow us. You have Breakstone to say, Okay, what kind of data do we need to make that kind of prediction. And you guys were very uh

686
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:08.720
Stanley Omeike: uh you a You came up with all of these uh data types that we need,

687
01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:43.869
Stanley Omeike: and I give you names for each of them for the outcome variable. If there are names we can use to refer to them target variable outcome. Very,

688
01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:18.339
Stanley Omeike: you know. Somebody give us a planetary variable. That's fine Uh: features. Are them predictable variables. Okay, So that's where we're coming from. Having understood the nature of the task that it takes around the Academy is asking about which is lend the skills required to decide which features

689
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:23.410
Stanley Omeike: I can be used, or should be useful during any given model.

690
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:51.929
Stanley Omeike: Um, we said, the two, we need the primary to we need for the that's not too called, not by or not depending on You ask. Okay, uh, if you ask uh, if Britain, if it breaks, is going to tell you, is not the if you ask that you don't buy so,

691
01:46:52.380 --> 01:47:06.479
Stanley Omeike: but we're not ready for that, because that's that one is for Ariz. All right, a raise and um vectors when all ready for that one to the primary two we're going to be using is conduct. So we what they found us, and that's the coolest to be.

692
01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:35.419
Stanley Omeike: So we bought that C. Bond just to be able to access. It's data data titles. And I gave you code to query to see all these data types. It has. So it is tested that get on the score data set on the small name brackets, and that will give you it to speed out all the data tables that see one is holding for you.

693
01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:46.480
Stanley Omeike: I'll make sure you put it, does it string,

694
01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.670
Stanley Omeike: and that's it to load it for you

695
01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:47.820
Stanley Omeike: in brackets. You put the full path to where the file is going to be saved. In my case it was the seat right.

696
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:56.120
Stanley Omeike: But when you see your details this week,

697
01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:12.010
Stanley Omeike: what fun does does is convex the index call. You see this index for you. That is not part of the data, but that's the index calling to call you in the day Time saves it for you sometimes. That's a lot of news that you don't want it, unless the index means something to you

698
01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:30.039
Stanley Omeike: from the Directory to we have the and that's index. It goes to faults, capital that not small app indexing go to phones that we went on. That saves that data

699
01:49:52.440 --> 01:50:06.360
Stanley Omeike: lesson Number one for you guys is learn how to load uh a Csv file from your full that onto your to be able to do that. The function we're going to use is the read on that called Csv Function

700
01:50:06.450 --> 01:50:08.540
Stanley Omeike: of Pandas.

701
01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:13.800
Stanley Omeike: Get a two moving paths. You need to have to be able to load any file.

702
01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:17.959
Stanley Omeike: One is the full name of the file with its extension.

703
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:27.259
Stanley Omeike: So the two moving parts you need to know

704
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.940
Stanley Omeike: the name of the file

705
01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:51.739
Stanley Omeike: to get the full. But if you are using windows eleven, the problem is for you already. Just right. Click the file

706
01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:54.919
Stanley Omeike: and take copy as part,

707
01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:02.809
Stanley Omeike: please. This is only if you're using windows. Eleven. If you are windows ten have to do it by not work like that. I'll show you how to do that one. Take copy as path.

708
01:51:12.450 --> 01:51:16.020
Stanley Omeike: It copied everything for me. Give me the full pass,

709
01:51:16.150 --> 01:51:20.130
Stanley Omeike: but I need to not change this to four slash,

710
01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.639
Stanley Omeike: or if I can use it,

711
01:51:35.450 --> 01:51:49.270
Stanley Omeike: and I'm just going to move down on this other brackets. Yeah, okay. So if I run this now, if you need my data straight. I run that now. I have Df to ask my data. I mean that down here and run it. You see, I have the data,

712
01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:52.790
Stanley Omeike: so that

713
01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:08.290
Stanley Omeike: that click on properties, anything,

714
01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.789
Stanley Omeike: click on properties. The window will open

715
01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:13.639
Stanley Omeike: this window.

716
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:16.620
Stanley Omeike: In that window

717
01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:19.169
Stanley Omeike: there is an entry called Location

718
01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:23.489
Stanley Omeike: Location gives you where the file is. Thought You see this.

719
01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.970
Stanley Omeike: That's where the finally starts

720
01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:31.280
Stanley Omeike: right. If you go to details, you also see it.

721
01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:49.620
Stanley Omeike: I'll go to my.

722
01:52:50.650 --> 01:52:52.840
Stanley Omeike: It's supposed to that.

723
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:56.920
Stanley Omeike: All right now. I have to put it in bracket, because it will be a stream,

724
01:52:56.990 --> 01:53:00.689
Stanley Omeike: and I need to change the best backwards last before slash

725
01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:03.759
Stanley Omeike: and add the four slash in the end.

726
01:53:04.670 --> 01:53:08.270
Stanley Omeike: That's what I need to do. Then I go back again to

727
01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:23.130
Stanley Omeike: come back here.

728
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:25.620
Stanley Omeike: I'll see file

729
01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:55.340
Stanley Omeike: to those

730
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:56.580
Stanley Omeike: Finally,

731
01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:00.960
Stanley Omeike: All right, if I run that.

732
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:23.139
Stanley Omeike: Uh: okay. This is because I've not run this. I'm: I think we've experienced this problem in a lot of we're doing, python, if you don't run this, so we you declare the variable before you use it. What if I don't say to you?

733
01:54:24.670 --> 01:54:32.680
Stanley Omeike: Not just fine, not the fine, So most I see that I do only sell somewhere, so i'll go back and run this. So

734
01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:38.499
Stanley Omeike: now, if I run it not defined as well. But now I can think this, I'll bring it out.

735
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:59.849
Stanley Omeike: So this represents this. So now I can proceed with what that is we're talking about, we'll learn how to get the shape of our data. Okay, yes,

736
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:03.930
Stanley Omeike: that's visa,

737
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:07.719
Stanley Omeike: said she.

738
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:10.749
Stanley Omeike: Okay, which simply is number

739
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:12.719
Stanley Omeike: all features

740
01:55:13.690 --> 01:55:15.120
Stanley Omeike: on samples.

741
01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:18.510
Stanley Omeike: So this will be my

742
01:55:19.410 --> 01:55:28.180
Stanley Omeike: I will see we just uh our procedure. It us sets. Where is it again? Our

743
01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.990
Stanley Omeike: that she

744
01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:44.440
Stanley Omeike: like? I said earlier. This tells me. I have ten people or ten columns and fifty-three thousand one hundred and forty samples or rules in the data.

745
01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:56.580
Imaikop Bassey: Okay,

746
01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:58.819
Stanley Omeike: so that will be detail sets

747
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:03.800
Stanley Omeike: uh

748
01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:08.719
my data,

749
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:29.009
Dot call you

750
01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:33.809
Stanley Omeike: right? So at the end of this, if I say print calls,

751
01:56:34.190 --> 01:56:37.030
Stanley Omeike: you see, I have the base. So this is where we were.

752
01:56:38.690 --> 01:56:43.629
Stanley Omeike: Now that we got in this. Well, let us now see very simple ways of examining our data.

753
01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:53.340
Stanley Omeike: Okay, let me.

754
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:54.870
It's correct

755
01:56:55.650 --> 01:56:57.680
Stanley Omeike: the

756
01:56:58.930 --> 01:57:00.500
Stanley Omeike: uh details right

757
01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:03.330
Stanley Omeike: of the features

758
01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.980
Stanley Omeike: data using

759
01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:10.030
Stanley Omeike: dot info.

760
01:57:10.730 --> 01:57:22.900
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So we're going to use that info to inspect the kind of properties of features our data to us, all right. So i'm going to write the code to be data set Dot in full.

761
01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.260
Stanley Omeike: Okay, I missed.

762
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:45.790
Stanley Omeike: Now, this is the summary table of the properties of our data, and it's important that you guys learned to read this table. Right. Don't don't panic it's very easy. It's a like my friends from Zambia, which is for

763
01:57:46.110 --> 01:57:47.120
Boniface Abutu: all right.

764
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:57.590
Stanley Omeike: Yeah, it is porridge for those of you in Nigeria. You will see it's my so let's let's examine these two.

765
01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:24.600
Stanley Omeike: Okay, So in we have fifty-three thousand nine hundred and forty samples. In our data we have ten volumes in the data. Then what he then does proceed to do is, take each call you and give us the information about its contents.

766
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:47.270
MUIZZ ADIO: Are you guys with me?

767
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:55.559
Stanley Omeike: Yes, okay. So So if you are trying to find out if data is missing in any of the columns of your data,

768
01:58:55.610 --> 01:59:05.759
Stanley Omeike: I think that again, because of all we're not listening. You were trying to find out. If there is any missing data in any of the volumes of your data sets,

769
01:59:09.210 --> 01:59:11.920
Stanley Omeike: they check this particular quality, not all.

770
01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:16.300
Stanley Omeike: If here is less than this.

771
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:23.190
Stanley Omeike: If this number,

772
01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:32.919
Stanley Omeike: we understand that.

773
01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:46.080
Stanley Omeike: Okay, it works together with this, not no, not which. Call you. How many columns have they in them?

774
01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:47.690
Stanley Omeike: Okay?

775
01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:51.739
Stanley Omeike: And Then the

776
01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:55.829
he said to be a flute. You guys already know what it is.

777
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:57.839
Godwin Ubogun: Yes,

778
02:00:17.850 --> 02:00:18.959
Stanley Omeike: thank you.

779
02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:22.959
Stanley Omeike: Alright, If I go back to that, call you to check those three columns.

780
02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:43.590
Okay,

781
02:00:49.410 --> 02:00:51.990
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So we'll see

782
02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.679
Stanley Omeike: these uh

783
02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:56.490
Stanley Omeike: detail.

784
02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:58.689
Stanley Omeike: Thanks.

785
02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:02.269
Stanley Omeike: That's not numbers.

786
02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:03.809
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

787
02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:06.670
Stanley Omeike: for example,

788
02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:10.830
Stanley Omeike: Um

789
02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:12.269
Stanley Omeike: States

790
02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.690
Stanley Omeike: um. Call up.

791
02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:21.099
Stanley Omeike: What else?

792
02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.590
Stanley Omeike: Agenda?

793
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:26.409
Stanley Omeike: It easy. But

794
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:29.740
Stanley Omeike: was that it?

795
02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:34.529
Stanley Omeike: Okay, No. H.

796
02:01:44.070 --> 02:02:03.010
Stanley Omeike: Cod is describing okay, located quality, if you like, of the diamonds ideal premium Good. So it's a categorical variable. Common. It's the same thing. Clarity is the same, so they are not numbers. They are category two variables, but the rest are numbers. Current is a flute, because it has to decimal places.

797
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:08.130
Stanley Omeike: That is, the flute table is the fluid prices. Price. Is that

798
02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:10.419
Stanley Omeike: right? Price is that in Tj.

799
02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.879
Stanley Omeike: X, y, and Z are flute. So let's go back and check.

800
02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.039
Stanley Omeike: I see that price is on in the

801
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:27.330
Stanley Omeike: you see that is an in, but all the rest are fluid, with the exception of these three.

802
02:02:28.090 --> 02:02:42.410
Stanley Omeike: Okay and uh, this ones are uh are like streams, so we call them categorical variables. So this is how you use this particular dot info. You have to see okay, what kind of types are in my colleagues,

803
02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:52.369
Stanley Omeike: which fields are missing data and which ones are not missing data in my in my table. They is showing you how much memory they find you just do. That is ticket

804
02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.639
Stanley Omeike: four point one megabytes.

805
02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:57.880
Stanley Omeike: Now, here is the advice.

806
02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:00.489
Stanley Omeike: Are you guys with me, Rebecca? Are you here?

807
02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.769
MUIZZ ADIO: Yes, yes, uh,

808
02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:04.170
Stanley Omeike: Rebecca.

809
02:03:04.190 --> 02:03:06.340
Boniface Abutu: Yeah.

810
02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:08.220
Stanley Omeike: Now you have a Rebecca. Now

811
02:03:12.850 --> 02:03:14.380
CJay - Chijioke Nnabueze: he's

812
02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:44.250
Stanley Omeike: because it

813
02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:06.349
Stanley Omeike: using

814
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:07.790
Stanley Omeike: dot head

815
02:04:12.850 --> 02:04:13.809
right

816
02:04:14.710 --> 02:04:20.889
Stanley Omeike: that allows you to grab a few samples from the data. You don't need to see everything seeing it. Doesn't change everything.

817
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:24.399
Stanley Omeike: You just want to see a few samples. So the data sets

818
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:25.940
Stanley Omeike: dot head.

819
02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:34.090
Stanley Omeike: Now, if you leave it without specifying how many rules or samples you want to you like, that is going to give you only five rules

820
02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:39.720
Stanley Omeike: right? So he returns five rules. So this returns

821
02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:42.130
Stanley Omeike: right. Rules

822
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:49.420
Stanley Omeike: specify

823
02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:02.460
Stanley Omeike: all right. So this gives us five rules. However, If I want twenty rules I can see data sets

824
02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:04.949
Stanley Omeike: Dot head,

825
02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:08.920
Stanley Omeike: and i'll put twenty in that bracket

826
02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:11.349
Stanley Omeike: all right, twenty.

827
02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:13.810
Stanley Omeike: So this will return twenty years

828
02:05:17.490 --> 02:05:18.340
Boniface Abutu: food

829
02:05:18.630 --> 02:05:20.990
Stanley Omeike: right? So if I run it now, you can see,

830
02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:23.710
Stanley Omeike: alright, returns twenty loose for me,

831
02:05:47.010 --> 02:05:48.370
female,

832
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:51.280
Stanley Omeike: so you

833
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:54.780
CJay - Chijioke Nnabueze: he is

834
02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:15.459
MUIZZ ADIO: the only past one. All you will.

835
02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:18.479
Stanley Omeike: Uh, I think, he said, you have no question

836
02:06:20.230 --> 02:06:24.119
MUIZZ ADIO: that. Why, you don't know I I have a small question.

837
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:26.949
Stanley Omeike: All right.

838
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:46.950
Stanley Omeike: Peak means. Can you

839
02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:51.219
Stanley Omeike: look at the

840
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:10.570
Stanley Omeike: sometimes. You're not just interested in the you just want to look at a random return. So I can see data sets dot sample.

841
02:07:11.330 --> 02:07:12.320
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

842
02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:16.679
Stanley Omeike: the sample means randomly. Grab any data for me

843
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:22.739
Stanley Omeike: in detail, and you can't specify how many you want you to grab. All right. So let me specify

844
02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:24.559
Stanley Omeike: uh ten.

845
02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:31.420
Stanley Omeike: Are you guys with me so far?

846
02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:32.880
Boniface Abutu: Yes, sir.

847
02:07:33.150 --> 02:07:35.190
Stanley Omeike: Okay, yes. So

848
02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:40.750
Stanley Omeike: So we are good at the level of being able to inspect our data.

849
02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:48.880
Adebisi Enochoghene: Okay, Thank you, Doctor. Um

850
02:07:54.180 --> 02:08:00.290
Adebisi Enochoghene: text or activities to practice onto the next boot camp.

851
02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:18.430
Stanley Omeike: That's a good question. Yes, you will receive textbooks that you'll be working with uh next week is your self based learning? There' be material for you to study. Trust me, and of course there will also be a piece for you towards Thursday, Friday next week that you have to write.

852
02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:27.570
Stanley Omeike: Um. So that's how we track your performance across the program. You do yourself. We study from Monday to Wednesday by Thursday morning,

853
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:41.639
Stanley Omeike: and then you have a whole day to at least

854
02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.709
Stanley Omeike: so Yes,

855
02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:49.129
uh, Louise,

856
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:50.889
Stanley Omeike: how do you?

857
02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:13.549
Stanley Omeike: Um? Which is not the beginning? So let's please. I'm not hearing if you're speaking. Sorry

858
02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:16.559
MUIZZ ADIO: Exactly.

859
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:21.480
Stanley Omeike: Uh: we. I still can't hear you.

860
02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:25.419
MUIZZ ADIO: Hello. So yeah, we

861
02:09:26.090 --> 02:09:27.199
Okay. So

862
02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:30.550
Boniface Abutu: muted himself.

863
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:35.409
Stanley Omeike: All right.

864
02:09:36.170 --> 02:09:37.980
Bola Jacob: Thank you very much.

865
02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:41.740
Stanley Omeike: Okay? Well, I But uh, please hold on. Let's see if we can speak. Now.

866
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:43.690
Alright,

867
02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:48.270
MUIZZ ADIO: my question is that and a zoom room we are we mixing

868
02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.570
Bola Jacob: as we? You have what

869
02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:06.409
MUIZZ ADIO: it makes zoom value. It means maybe it makes you a value from one of our

870
02:10:06.530 --> 02:10:09.620
Stanley Omeike: okay. How would you do the with me in values.

871
02:10:15.290 --> 02:10:34.420
Stanley Omeike: So it is, for right now Carlos has no missing values costs. You see, the the the sales are all full. So any any line. We are the number here That is not the same thing as this. Study simply means that they are missing values. Yeah, and and that's the name of the call it that. Uh, Tibo price.

872
02:10:39.710 --> 02:10:40.639
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

873
02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:46.480
CJay - Chijioke Nnabueze: So so basically, this data looks.

874
02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:05.670
Stanley Omeike: So if I do something like this, and this is not for today's class, but you know just so that you guys can have something to choose. Uh.

875
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:08.940
Stanley Omeike: Okay, if I see data sets,

876
02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:11.820
Stanley Omeike: does he any?

877
02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:14.639
Stanley Omeike: That's not.

878
02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:22.239
Stanley Omeike: And I run this. This tells me, which call you, has me in values, and which one doesn't

879
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:26.539
Stanley Omeike: Are you guys with me so far?

880
02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:30.060
CJay - Chijioke Nnabueze: Yeah, yeah,

881
02:11:30.900 --> 02:11:37.010
Stanley Omeike: alright, but this is that we're going to come to it later. So this is just checking. She's a good Jesus,

882
02:11:40.830 --> 02:11:42.610
Stanley Omeike: you know these are.

883
02:11:57.070 --> 02:11:58.370
Raji Azeez: Yes,

884
02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:04.360
Rex Onwudinjo: but please

885
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:14.980
Bola Jacob: do I have your permission to use fifty more minutes or the

886
02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:33.310
Bola Jacob: so? Yeah, The The question I wanted to add was actually what the other person that's about uh, maybe missing values. Um, uh, maybe missing spaces and so on. I think he's talking about the tracking, and I believe we still get there. But My

887
02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:41.540
Bola Jacob: my question is, I want to make an appeal like for the Python Academy that we've done?

888
02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:56.480
Bola Jacob: Is it possible for the school That's institutions to just be giving us meaning to you for a personal practice development on weekly basis on that python, so that we don't just

889
02:12:56.490 --> 02:13:11.400
Bola Jacob: uh forget everything we go. If we don't constantly use it for me. I'm talking past now for myself, or if I don't completely use those. Okay? Well, I understand. Understand what you'll see. The the the beautiful thing is we are,

890
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:23.739
Stanley Omeike: so you'll find that all the I don't ski you you you're about to use it. Just watch the next ten minutes and see what happens. Okay, you're not going to worry me anything, I promise you that.

891
02:13:35.110 --> 02:13:43.390
Stanley Omeike: So remember that if we look at our data set and i'm just going to change its name. I don't want to be writing data set. I'll just say, here is the post to

892
02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:55.709
Stanley Omeike: it. Doesn't complete with any of the data we have before.

893
02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:59.459
Stanley Omeike: So I run this. So now I have my Dfs:

894
02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:02.019
Stanley Omeike: If I want to get

895
02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:09.110
Stanley Omeike: uh, look at my data sets. I can you to a lot of things from my details very easily. So let's see if you are. You

896
02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:14.080
Stanley Omeike: uh sorry Uh, You're sorry.

897
02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:25.320
Stanley Omeike: One calling.

898
02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:37.140
Stanley Omeike: Okay. If I call calls

899
02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:48.320
Stanley Omeike: it's only

900
02:14:49.070 --> 02:14:50.480
Stanley Omeike: the current

901
02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:51.610
Stanley Omeike: got it,

902
02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:08.410
Stanley Omeike: call you

903
02:15:08.590 --> 02:15:16.900
Stanley Omeike: if it was to that, so I can't run that now. I have access to just that calling. I can do this. That's my

904
02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:18.070
right,

905
02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:29.789
Stanley Omeike: and changes to.

906
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:41.130
Stanley Omeike: So if I run that,

907
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:59.199
Stanley Omeike: are you guys with me? So far, So now I can determine how many unique labels I have in that call you. Each of these entries are labels. So let's say it gets uniquely bills

908
02:16:00.410 --> 02:16:02.129
that's unique.

909
02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:03.889
Stanley Omeike: Number

910
02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:05.929
Stanley Omeike: of the bills

911
02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:09.279
Stanley Omeike: and the calls calling.

912
02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:11.630
Stanley Omeike: That will be.

913
02:16:19.710 --> 02:16:21.330
Stanley Omeike: That's unique.

914
02:16:26.770 --> 02:16:28.569
Stanley Omeike: All right. If I run that,

915
02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:33.130
Stanley Omeike: I see that. How many uniquely bills we have in that calling

916
02:16:34.799 --> 02:16:39.680
Bola Jacob: three, four, five, five, five,

917
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:52.180
Stanley Omeike: so very easy. I can see that there are five. Now, this technique is always important, because it kind of you see where there are arrows in the names, because I might see premium and see under a premium spell differently sometimes in the data

918
02:17:18.219 --> 02:17:19.350
costs.

919
02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:22.660
Stanley Omeike: Okay, that's unique.

920
02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:28.699
Stanley Omeike: I'm still getting the same thing Right?

921
02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:33.689
Boniface Abutu: Yes, correct. So it's either. I reference

922
02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:44.129
Stanley Omeike: Any of the methods will work,

923
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:51.789
Stanley Omeike: for example. Very good, you see. Very good.

924
02:17:51.930 --> 02:18:06.410
Stanley Omeike: So No, very good. There's nothing for the name. Let's go back and check. We don't have the calling name that has the two words in it, so we can't illustrate that. So your Cp. That is always to use the second method, because, regardless of how the name is it to rob?

925
02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:07.879
Stanley Omeike: All right.

926
02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:20.469
Stanley Omeike: So let's say challenge,

927
02:18:25.969 --> 02:18:29.349
Stanley Omeike: Get all the samples. Okay,

928
02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:39.139
Stanley Omeike: he's. Oh,

929
02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:40.549
Stanley Omeike: they bill

930
02:18:41.070 --> 02:18:42.100
premium.

931
02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:47.730
Stanley Omeike: Now, this is going to be a little bit tricky. So um.

932
02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:55.490
Stanley Omeike: So this is getting

933
02:18:56.420 --> 02:18:58.850
Stanley Omeike: all samples,

934
02:18:59.219 --> 02:19:00.809
Stanley Omeike: all that one

935
02:19:02.049 --> 02:19:03.480
Stanley Omeike: samples.

936
02:19:03.639 --> 02:19:05.090
That's our premium.

937
02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:09.829
Stanley Omeike: This will be

938
02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:11.779
Stanley Omeike: that's got a premium

939
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:15.520
Stanley Omeike: email samples

940
02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:19.500
Stanley Omeike: as it was through the

941
02:19:26.719 --> 02:19:28.420
Stanley Omeike: square brackets.

942
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:41.560
Stanley Omeike: Uh what is it again. I have X square brackets. I want to feel tab. Id called. Call you all right,

943
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:46.319
Stanley Omeike: and this will be where I call you. Is It goes to premium.

944
02:19:48.059 --> 02:19:51.740
Stanley Omeike: Right again. Let me explain the good before I run it.

945
02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:59.960
Stanley Omeike: I want to extract from our data and see this, our data here that has all kinds of um. Where is it again?

946
02:20:32.430 --> 02:20:34.890
Stanley Omeike: So, my conditional with Dfx.

947
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:51.330
Stanley Omeike: It does run so. Now, if I take premium and try to print it out, you will see that a premium should only contain samples that are,

948
02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:53.979
Stanley Omeike: I think, my spending of female is wrong.

949
02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:12.570
Stanley Omeike: So we run it. Now you can see that these are all premiums and all together. I have thirteen thousand seven hundred and ninety one sample.

950
02:21:13.410 --> 02:21:19.370
Stanley Omeike: Now, who can run future out for all the examples that are very good.

951
02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:22.640
Stanley Omeike: Who can have those righty goods? Oh, yeah,

952
02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:33.610
Stanley Omeike: Oh,

953
02:21:34.970 --> 02:21:37.800
Stanley Omeike: is the only place, and we

954
02:21:38.170 --> 02:21:43.759
Stanley Omeike: I have Google. How many students in this last today. Have sixty-three. Um:

955
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:51.460
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: Okay. So

956
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:59.610
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: okay. So we'll go with um. Very good,

957
02:21:59.890 --> 02:22:02.929
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: very good. Samples.

958
02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:07.310
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: Very good. Samples is it. Called Zoo.

959
02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:15.639
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: Yeah, very good. Samples and um. Df: X: Yeah, that's

960
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:17.260
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: those.

961
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:40.350
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: Yes, and then

962
02:22:40.470 --> 02:22:42.490
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: and um

963
02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:03.979
MUIZZ ADIO: it's called

964
02:23:04.590 --> 02:23:06.020
it four, six.

965
02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:24.710
Stanley Omeike: Okay, hold on. That equals No. Okay. So that's good. Don't: So for this class, when you any python class is okay to say W. In this class. Now, whenever I want to use this

966
02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:30.680
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: okay or identical to

967
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:50.360
Oluwaseun Bamgbose: all right. So what do you want to put now?

968
02:23:50.370 --> 02:24:04.320
Stanley Omeike: And he run without an error? So that's pretty tough. So very good. You did. Well, you see now You' to be able to fill it up for us. We are,

969
02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:11.090
Stanley Omeike: you know, all the items in this table where the price is greater than three hundred dollars.

970
02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:22.229
Boniface Abutu: My aunt is a

971
02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:32.840
Boniface Abutu: alright,

972
02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:35.110
Boniface Abutu: Oh,

973
02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:42.369
Boniface Abutu: okay, I'll give it. I'll give you I'll I'll give you. I'll give you. I'll give the available name to be uh

974
02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:47.900
Stanley Omeike: okay, price

975
02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:54.020
Boniface Abutu: or price below on uh three hundred,

976
02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:56.619
you know. Three hundred. Okay,

977
02:24:58.140 --> 02:24:59.580
This equals to

978
02:25:01.950 --> 02:25:03.110
Boniface Abutu: Dfx:

979
02:25:03.550 --> 02:25:04.810
Stanley Omeike: Dfx:

980
02:25:12.530 --> 02:25:13.810
Boniface Abutu: Hello.

981
02:25:18.350 --> 02:25:19.670
Boniface Abutu: Square bracket.

982
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:20.980
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

983
02:25:22.030 --> 02:25:23.190
Boniface Abutu: Yeah. Fix.

984
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:40.450
Boniface Abutu: Then the columns is price,

985
02:25:43.450 --> 02:25:44.420
I think.

986
02:25:47.330 --> 02:25:48.390
Boniface Abutu: Okay,

987
02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:53.190
Boniface Abutu: alright. Your square minimum Les down.

988
02:25:55.460 --> 02:25:59.410
Stanley Omeike: You really have a problem right now. But let's continue.

989
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:01.910
Boniface Abutu: Listen.

990
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:15.809
CJay - Chijioke Nnabueze: No, no, no. Don't price to a string.

991
02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:18.999
Stanley Omeike: So what do you think is the problem?

992
02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:23.739
Boniface Abutu: Price is three.

993
02:26:23.770 --> 02:26:29.980
Stanley Omeike: So if we check now, let's see how many.

994
02:26:39.350 --> 02:26:41.300
Stanley Omeike: Let's see. Uh,

995
02:26:41.890 --> 02:26:45.709
Stanley Omeike: let's see. Uh three.

996
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:53.879
Boniface Abutu: Oh, we have. Let's put like um, maybe five phone right now.

997
02:26:59.570 --> 02:27:00.420
Okay,

998
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:03.690
Stanley Omeike: Okay. So we have something here. Yes.

999
02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:13.379
Stanley Omeike: Oh, you see, we got just two hundred, four, two, two, four, seven.

1000
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:15.000
Okay,

1001
02:27:23.810 --> 02:27:25.360
Stanley Omeike: not love you

1002
02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:29.570
of the

1003
02:27:32.770 --> 02:27:35.729
Stanley Omeike: So this will be Df: the price

1004
02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:44.039
Stanley Omeike: alright, So that's my maximum value.

1005
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:46.720
Stanley Omeike: I got it so far.

1006
02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.269
Boniface Abutu: That's right.

1007
02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:55.800
I'm sorry

1008
02:27:56.450 --> 02:27:59.040
Stanley Omeike: if the prize does mean,

1009
02:28:21.300 --> 02:28:23.149
Stanley Omeike: but not to good speed today

1010
02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:29.459
Stanley Omeike: uh what we've done today is give you what I thought was a gentle introduction, but I think it got a little bit uh

1011
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:48.329
Stanley Omeike: complex along the road. Uh, but we give you a gently reduction to Pandas today, and the lessons we've learned today uh one how to load data and how to save data. Okay, to drive, we lunch that one we where is saved, and we do that back.

1012
02:28:54.380 --> 02:29:09.290
Stanley Omeike: Once we do that. They We went ahead to start carrying out some inspections of the data. They have some bonuses we had around the way like how to. You see, on to access sample data. So i'm not going to count that as part of our call. I mean, It's just a bonus uh lesson.

1013
02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:29.039
Stanley Omeike: So, but she helps us understand the dimensions of our data, so that we know what we're dealing with, and the size of the data. This is quite a bit.

1014
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:37.340
Stanley Omeike: We also learned how to extract the names of the columns of the data. I put it in the list. So tomorrow, if I tell you uh,

1015
02:29:55.270 --> 02:30:00.840
Stanley Omeike: then we uh learned how to um slice our data.

1016
02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:09.360
Stanley Omeike: Okay, by slicing data, i'm talking about being able. Okay, before we learn about license, we let out to use that info to inspect

1017
02:30:09.370 --> 02:30:27.840
Stanley Omeike: the properties of our data. For example, the data types, and if they are missing values in our data. We launched out. I also told us another cool way to determine missing values in the data using Dot is a dot. So so you guys love that. And then what I understand learning how to uh extract collum in the data.

1018
02:30:41.770 --> 02:31:01.279
Stanley Omeike: So after that, I, just with the total, how to get the maximum. I mean more values, because when we're trying to feel that we have any problem determining what was your reach of the time that call you. So whenever you run into that problem where you're trying to determine what it's, it's the email Max on the recording that will give it to you

1019
02:31:01.290 --> 02:31:14.990
Stanley Omeike: now that you don't need cool, and and this is just something you should practice. I'm not going to explain it. I'm going to run it and um at the end of class I will spend probably five minutes listening to anybody who wants to ask the question. So i'll see. Calls

1020
02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:18.480
Stanley Omeike: is equal to Dfx.

1021
02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:27.489
Stanley Omeike: That's two of these

1022
02:31:31.430 --> 02:31:32.920
Stanley Omeike: for calls.

1023
02:31:33.610 --> 02:31:34.750
Oh, cool

1024
02:31:35.700 --> 02:31:37.130
calls.

1025
02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:40.920
I must be here, then.

1026
02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:43.909
Stanley Omeike: Uh detail,

1027
02:31:44.390 --> 02:31:45.440
Then

1028
02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:47.370
it's about to. Then,

1029
02:31:56.390 --> 02:32:00.589
Stanley Omeike: if Len brackets Dfx

1030
02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:02.740
Stanley Omeike: square bracket the call.

1031
02:32:04.060 --> 02:32:05.119
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

1032
02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:12.280
Stanley Omeike: he's less done.

1033
02:32:13.570 --> 02:32:15.090
Stanley Omeike: That's all. In

1034
02:32:19.160 --> 02:32:20.110
Stanley Omeike: this.

1035
02:32:21.020 --> 02:32:22.780
Stanley Omeike: He's deposed to

1036
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:32.880
Stanley Omeike: the Is it? One to

1037
02:32:33.850 --> 02:32:35.150
Stanley Omeike: That's all in

1038
02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:41.660
Stanley Omeike: minus nine.

1039
02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:46.510
Stanley Omeike: The fx square rocket call,

1040
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:50.039
Stanley Omeike: so i'll see uh Prince

1041
02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:52.949
Stanley Omeike: records.

1042
02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:02.080
Stanley Omeike: That's That's

1043
02:33:02.650 --> 02:33:04.220
Stanley Omeike: it is missing

1044
02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:08.520
Stanley Omeike: number.

1045
02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:09.949
Oh,

1046
02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:11.460
Stanley Omeike: samples.

1047
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:13.130
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

1048
02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:23.050
Stanley Omeike: So let me run this good now. But if I run it i'm gonna say

1049
02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:26.880
our call

1050
02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:33.420
Stanley Omeike: uh this is F here because i'm using string for Martin.

1051
02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:35.820
Stanley Omeike: He's missing this.

1052
02:33:38.330 --> 02:33:41.519
Stanley Omeike: So that's it. So let me run this.

1053
02:33:44.590 --> 02:33:54.540
Stanley Omeike: So this condition is, is not going to be Max, because, uh, they are not missing bodies. So let me add an L statement so that we can see else.

1054
02:33:55.740 --> 02:34:00.770
Stanley Omeike: So you know, guys, let me illustrate this with a very simple example.

1055
02:34:00.910 --> 02:34:02.190
Bye bye,

1056
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:22.379
Stanley Omeike: I don't want to

1057
02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:27.629
Stanley Omeike: we out of time. So they do my data i'm going to.

1058
02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:28.910
Stanley Omeike: Uh

1059

1060
02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:57.839
Stanley Omeike: all right. So let's go back. And so yeah, we're just going to import our data now.

1061
02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:15.130
Stanley Omeike: So say Uh. The F. I. Is. People also Pd. To read on the of Csv in brackets is going to be in my drive, C Cool on forward slash uh workspace.

1062
02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:16.289
Yes,

1063

Stanley Omeike: So that's one That's: Yeah. So my

1069
02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:42.480
Stanley Omeike: those block else

1070
02:35:42.930 --> 02:35:44.300
Stanley Omeike: friends

1071

Stanley Omeike: i'm just I was Russian.

1073
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.970
Stanley Omeike: Um,

1074
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:09.340
Stanley Omeike: So it's not finding any data just because we are using

1075
02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:10.650
Stanley Omeike: uh

1076
02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:13.380
Stanley Omeike: there.

1077
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:26.890
Stanley Omeike: Um, So let's do one thing here

1078
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:29.430
that once

1079
02:36:30.690 --> 02:36:32.490
one. That's

1080
02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:34.689
Stanley Omeike: It's an a

1081
02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:36.760
that so,

1082
02:36:42.490 --> 02:36:45.390
Stanley Omeike: or I do, if I

1083
02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:53.410
Stanley Omeike: So this is the d thirty one. I just walked on. Okay, with me in data.

1084
02:37:00.770 --> 02:37:02.280
Stanley Omeike: Let's see.

1085
02:37:03.330 --> 02:37:04.500
Stanley Omeike: Let me see

1086
02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:06.449
right

1087
02:37:06.620 --> 02:37:08.599
Stanley Omeike: if it was to

1088
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:12.219
Stanley Omeike: D. F. I does

1089
02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:14.500
It's

1090
02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:18.670
that's all

1091
02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:21.780
Stanley Omeike: all right. So i'm using this in like,

1092
02:37:23.290 --> 02:37:24.960
Stanley Omeike: so for all

1093
02:37:25.470 --> 02:37:26.320
Stanley Omeike: come up

1094
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:28.699
Stanley Omeike: right

1095
02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:30.900
in Zoom.

1096
02:37:35.130 --> 02:37:36.000
See?

1097
02:37:37.230 --> 02:37:38.650
Stanley Omeike: Oh,

1098
02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:54.730
Boniface Abutu: yes, sir.

1099
02:37:55.460 --> 02:37:57.049
CJay - Chijioke Nnabueze: Yes, you

1100
02:37:57.380 --> 02:37:59.449
Stanley Omeike: okay. So this will be Everett,

1101
02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:07.619
Stanley Omeike: all right.

1102
02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:12.970
Boniface Abutu: That that there is

1103
02:38:16.210 --> 02:38:17.849
Boniface Abutu: it uh less down there?

1104
02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:28.350
Stanley Omeike: It's great that we need not less than you. Right is, uh, Prince. Okay? Um,

1105
02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:30.539
Stanley Omeike: This will be wreck.

1106
02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:34.539
Stanley Omeike: Okay, So we're on that

1107
02:38:35.130 --> 02:38:38.329
Stanley Omeike: good. So it's not what you guys see that?

1108
02:38:40.390 --> 02:38:51.710
Stanley Omeike: Yes, sir, no clarity is missing uh this data that is missing that data that will be in that data. Now that this is working. I can reduce this to a function.

1109
02:38:52.190 --> 02:39:03.900
Stanley Omeike: Remember, we thought you guys function so that you can see that everything you learn is still useful, so that next week at Thebc. Can be very busy.

1110
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:13.250
Stanley Omeike: Is that Abc. There?

1111
02:39:14.290 --> 02:39:15.590
Stanley Omeike: So Us.

1112
02:39:34.810 --> 02:39:48.609
Stanley Omeike: Alright, So i'm going to invent this in. So now the application function. Let me show you the functional. So we get the data sets. The first one to do is get the call into the data system. This is going to be data sets.

1113
02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:15.610
Stanley Omeike: Alright So now I get that assigned to Dfi, I get the columns in the data. I complete missing values in the data. I get the length of the data which I right now do not need What? That's fine. Then I look through the columns and the records uh and find out what is missing.

1114
02:40:22.690 --> 02:40:25.719
Stanley Omeike: So yeah, let's call this um

1115
02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:27.909
Stanley Omeike: me seeing

1116
02:40:29.090 --> 02:40:31.090
Stanley Omeike: uh reports.

1117
02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:38.550
Stanley Omeike: So at this point i'll see if that is there uh missing

1118
02:40:38.830 --> 02:40:41.889
Stanley Omeike: reports that appends

1119
02:40:42.310 --> 02:40:43.730
Stanley Omeike: in brackets.

1120
02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:45.310
Stanley Omeike: Um:

1121
02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:51.009
This information control copy,

1122
02:40:57.390 --> 02:40:58.330
Stanley Omeike: Okay,

1123
02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:01.710
Stanley Omeike: and this. Now we can be seen, reports

1124
02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:03.720
Stanley Omeike: those up, and

1125
02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:06.479
Stanley Omeike: until the

1126
02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:11.329
Stanley Omeike: brackets we all this information,

1127
02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:13.800
Godwin Ubogun: the music report up.

1128
02:41:14.260 --> 02:41:16.949
Godwin Ubogun: It's not complete.

1129
02:41:18.350 --> 02:41:19.550
Stanley Omeike: Is it this one?

1130
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:25.440
Stanley Omeike: Yes, you could just do that. You don't have any

1131
02:41:25.690 --> 02:41:35.809
Stanley Omeike: big English coming from this good one. We're on it. Okay. So this is fine. Now, at the end of the day, all I want Remember, we talk about it on statements. All I want is for this to return.

1132
02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:37.870
Stanley Omeike: We see it

1133
02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:40.139
Stanley Omeike: all right. Hey, Guys with me?

1134
02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:47.900
Stanley Omeike: Yes. So let's run this and see if it works just by calling this function and pass into it Our data sets.

1135
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:51.799
Stanley Omeike: What's our data set? Um

1136
02:41:57.370 --> 02:41:58.530
Stanley Omeike: run that.

1137
02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:00.530
Stanley Omeike: See that?

1138
02:42:01.770 --> 02:42:05.129
Stanley Omeike: Now, this printing i'm getting here. This line

1139
02:42:05.250 --> 02:42:09.150
Stanley Omeike: is because of this print springs. So let me mute, different,

1140
02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:21.840
Stanley Omeike: alright, So I mean that it brings out on that function again. Now, when I run the code. So now I have a very possible cool to check for missing values regardless of the

1141
02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:23.719
Stanley Omeike: Are you guys with me so far?

1142
02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:50.789
Stanley Omeike: So we're going to be letting a lot of how to do this. So by some way down with this Academy you'll be both data around the Us. All right. So classes Don't for today. I promise to make sure we have blue. These for you guys. Um, tonight, please. Tonight Is

1143
02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:57.329
Stanley Omeike: that time? So don't go check ten Pm. You're like you guys are on the day. Okay,

1144
02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:03.540
Stanley Omeike: alright, uh, thanks, guys. I hope to this class was useful for you guys.

1152
02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:43.880
Godstime Edet: So I want to. I want to find out. Are the data set. Are they pro proper data type? And if

1153
02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:50.150
okay,

1154
02:44:51.500 --> 02:44:54.720

1155
02:44:54.830 --> 02:45:03.519
Godstime Edet: Now, seeing this information about the data set. Now, I want to find out the data set. Are they in the proper data type?

1156
02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:04.470
Stella Okenu: Okay,

1157

1162
02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:47.740
Simon Garba: our project,

1163
02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:49.209
Stanley Omeike: You said

1164
02:46:50.610 --> 02:46:52.260
Simon Garba: That is now a project,

1165

JOHN EMEKA: Hello. This

1182
02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:55.699
Stanley Omeike: i'm with you where i'm. Now just let me hear from you. Where else?

1183
02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:01.760
eenwerem: Uh i'm previous I've got this um I haven't,

1184
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:04.070
eenwerem: but um I think

1185
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:06.430
eenwerem: I didn't understand

1186
02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:19.180
eenwerem: what um that I mean, we we you will certified the grab. You run down some. I would want to study from that area. What? Actually

1187
02:49:28.250 --> 02:49:38.580
Stanley Omeike: I I have I I don't. I don't i'm i'm assuming that what you see.

1188
02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:40.499
Stanley Omeike: Oh,

1189
02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:56.820
Stanley Omeike: what's that? Why, I switch was because it will get me to a topic that I didn't want to go into uh, you know, at that point. So I use it simpler way to go about it later. We would implement that code using a different method. So that's what I've done. Now, if you're seeing

1190
02:49:56.900 --> 02:50:06.829
Stanley Omeike: your network affected, your ability to follow the class, please just watch the video. Um, you will get the same value all right. Uh, let's go with Joshua Olar in the

1191
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:09.090
Odion Joel Okonofua: so.

1192
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:12.910
Stanley Omeike: Yes, Joshua

1193
02:50:16.180 --> 02:50:19.600
Joshua, I don't know what is it? The network. Or is it me?

1194
02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:22.230
JOSHUA OLARINDE: Okay,

1195
02:50:23.070 --> 02:50:24.900
Stanley Omeike: just right. Eight hundred and ninety-eight,

1196
02:50:28.770 --> 02:50:30.800
Stanley Omeike: and go on speaking. Let me see,

1197
02:50:35.130 --> 02:50:52.880
JOSHUA OLARINDE: alright. Sir. So I I have a question. Maudi put this submission by so um some, said the submitted alien; but if no got in the meal to join the deck in detail around me, I don't know if that is whole for the second name you would be some meals to be sent.

1198
02:50:53.730 --> 02:51:07.140
Stanley Omeike: So these they have three things happening here. Meals have been sent to all those who submitted on this project. Some bills are bouncing back that because people's emails are not properly uh written.

1199
02:51:07.430 --> 02:51:22.330
